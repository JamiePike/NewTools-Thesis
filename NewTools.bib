   abstract = {The fungus Fusarium oxysporum is infamous for its devastating effects on economically important crops worldwide. F. oxysporum isolates are grouped into formae speciales based on their ability to cause disease on different hosts. Assigning F. oxysporum strains to formae speciales using non-experimental procedures has proven to be challenging due to their genetic heterogeneity and polyphyletic nature. However, genetically diverse isolates of the same forma specialis encode similar repertoires of effectors, proteins that are secreted by the fungus and contribute to the establishment of compatibility with the host. Based on this observation, we previously designed the F. oxysporum Effector Clustering (FoEC) pipeline which is able to classify F. oxysporum strains by forma specialis based on hierarchical clustering of the presence of predicted putative effector sequences, solely using genome assemblies as input. Here we present the updated FoEC2 pipeline which is more user friendly, customizable and, due to multithreading, has improved scalability. It is designed as a Snakemake pipeline and incorporates a new interactive visualization app. We showcase FoEC2 by clustering 537 publicly available F. oxysporum genomes and further analysis of putative effector families as multiple sequence alignments. We confirm classification of isolates into formae speciales and are able to further identify their subtypes. The pipeline is available on github: https://github.com/pvdam3/FoEC2.},

@article{Gutierrez2023,
   abstract = {Fusarium spp. comprise various species of filamentous fungi that cause severe diseases in plant crops of both agricultural and forestry interest. These plant pathogens produce a wide range of molecules with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Genetic functional analyses of some of these compounds have shown their role as virulence factors (VF). However, their mode of action and contributions to the infection process for many of these molecules are still unknown. This review aims to analyze the state of the art in Fusarium VF, emphasizing their biological targets on the plant hosts. It also addresses the current experimental approaches to improve our understanding of their role in virulence and suggests relevant research questions that remain to be answered with a greater focus on species of agroeconomic importance. In this review, a total of 37 confirmed VF are described, including 22 proteinaceous and 15 non-proteinaceous molecules, mainly from Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium graminearum and, to a lesser extent, in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium solani.},

@article{Acuna2022,
   abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), is currently the major threat to the banana industry worldwide (Dita et al. 2018). Restricted to South Asia for more than 20 years, Foc TR4 has spread in the last years to the Middle East, Mozambique, and Colombia (Garc ıa-Bastidas et al. 2020; https://pestdisplace. org/embed/news/map/disease/11). The incursion of Foc TR4 in Colombia increased awareness and prevention efforts across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). However, new Foc TR4 outbreaks in LAC countries were considered inevitable. In April 2021, banana (Musa spp., Cavendish, AAA) plants (30% of incidence) showing typical symptoms of FWB, such as leaf yellowing, wilting, and vascular discoloration, were observed in one farm (about 1 ha) located in Querecotillo, Peru (4 43954.840 S, 80 33945.000 W). Mycological analyses of samples (pseudostem strands) collected from 10 symptomatic plants were performed as described by Dita et al. (2010). These analyses revealed a continuous presence of fungal colonies identified as F. oxysporum species complex. Molecular diagnostics targeting two different genome regions (Dita et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013) identified nine of these isolates as Foc TR4. These results were further confirmed by qPCR analyses using the commercial Clear Detections TR4 kit. The genomes of four single-spore isolates (PerS1, PerS2, PerS3, and PerS4) were sequenced using the Illumina platform (MiSeq Kit, 2x151 bp Paired-End). The strain PerS4 was also sequenced using Oxford Nanopore (FLOW-MIN111; R10.3 chemistry) as described by L opez-Alvarez et al. (2020). The generated draft assembly yielded 533 contigs for a size of 47 Mbp (BioProject: PRJNA755905), which is comparable with sizes of previously reported Foc TR4 strains (Asai et al. 2019; Garc ıa-Bastidas et al. 2020; Maymon et al. 2020; Warmington et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2018). The sequence assembly showed high contiguity (94.9%) and high similarity (95.48%) with the high-quality genome sequence of the Foc TR4 isolate 'UK0001' (Warmington et al. 2019). Further analyses to identify the presence/absence of full sequences for the putative effector genes (Secreted in Xylem-SIX) and their allelic copies also revealed that the SIX gene profiles of the strains isolated from Querecotillo matched with previously reported Foc TR4 isolates (Czislowski et al. 2017). Pathogenicity tests with three isolates and water controls were performed as described by Dita et al. (2010), using five Cavendish plantlets per treatment. Four weeks after the inoculation, typical external and internal symptoms of FWB were observed only in the inoculated plants. Fungal isolates recovered from inocu-lated plants tested positive for Foc TR4 when analyzed with PCR diagnostics as mentioned above. No fungal isolates were recovered from water-control plants, which did not show any symptoms. Altogether, our results confirm the first incursion of Foc TR4 in Peru. Currently, Foc TR4 has the phytosani-tary status of a present pest with restricted distribution in Peru, and it is under official control of the National Plant Protection Organization-SENASA. Reinforced prevention and quarantine measures, disease monitoring, and capacity building to detect, contain and manage eventual new outbreaks of Foc TR4 are strongly encouraged across LAC banana-producing countries, especially those bordering Peru with larger banana plantations, such as Ecua-dor and Brazil.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is an important disease of banana in almost all banana-producing countries of the world. The recent occurrence of a highly virulent form of Foc in Asia, known as 'tropical race 4' (TR4), presents an imminent threat to the region's Cavendish-based banana industries. Foc-TR4 has caused severe damage to the Cavendish banana industry of Taiwan since 1967, destroyed new plantations of Cavendish banana in Indonesia and Malaysia since the early 1990s and caused field epidemics in the Northern Territory of Australia between 1997 and 1999. In 2004, severe Foc infection in banana plantations in Guangdong province, South China, heightened the TR4 threat. All outbreaks are associated with the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) complex 1213/16. Historical field observations of Foc in Cavendish banana cultivars in the Philippines since 1970 are described. More than 30,000 individual reports of infection were officially recorded in the Philippines from 1974 to 1991. These infections were tested and identified as VCG 0122, 0123 and 0126, which are believed to be less virulent than the VCG 01213/16 complex. In September 2006, 30 infected plant samples were collected from highland and lowland Cavendish banana farms in Davao. These samples confirmed that the recent outbreaks of Fusarium wilt in Cavendish in the Philippines were caused by the VCG 01213/16 complex. The Philippine government, private banana companies and Bioversity International are collaborating to manage the disease and to try to contain further spread of Foc-TR4.},

Race 4 affects cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the subtropics, as well as race 1 and race 2 suscepts. It has caused concern in the tropically based export trades which depend almost entirely on the Cavendish clones. Attention is also drawn to affected non‐exported bananas which are important cash crops or staple foods. Although they are not as well documented as those on the Cavendish subgroup, epidemics of the disease on non‐exported bananas are far more important. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Banana (Musa spp.) is one of the world's most important fruits. In 2011, 145 million metric tons, worth an estimated $44 billion, were produced in over 130 countries. Fusarium wilt (also known as Panama disease) is one of the most destructive diseases of this crop. It devastated the 'Gros Michel'-based export trades before the mid-1900s, and threatens the Cavendish cultivars that were used to replace it; in total, the latter cultivars are now responsible for approximately 45% of all production. An overview of the disease and its causal agent, Fusarium oxysporum f. Sp. Cubense, is presented below. Despite a substantial positive literature on biological, chemical, or cultural measures, management is largely restricted to excluding F. oxysporum f. Sp. Cubense from noninfested areas and using resistant cultivars where the pathogen has established. Resistance to Fusarium wilt is poor in several breeding targets, including important dessert and cooking cultivars. Better resistance to this and other diseases is needed. The history and impact of Fusarium wilt is summarized with an emphasis on tropical race 4 (TR4), a 'Cavendish'-killing variant of the pathogen that has spread dramatically in the Eastern Hemisphere.},

Fusarium wilt, which is also known as Panama disease, is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). It is one of the most destructive diseases of this crop, and has a relatively wide host range. Its greatest impact was on the early 'Gros Michel'-based export trades. Resistant cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup were used to replace 'Gros Michel,' but are now succumbing to a new variant of the pathogen, tropical race 4 (TR4). Although TR4 is only found in the Eastern Hemisphere, it threatens global export and small-holder production of the Cavendish cultivars. Management of this disease is largely restricted to excluding the pathogen from non-infested areas and the use of resistant cultivars where Foc is established. The perennial production of this crop and the polycyclic nature of this disease hinder the development of other management strategies. Measures that are effective against annual or short-lived hosts of these diseases are usually ineffective against Fusarium wilt of banana. Effective biological, chemical and cultural measures are not available, despite a substantial, positive literature on these topics. Critical evaluations of, and realistic expectations for, these measures are needed. Better resistance is needed to this disease, especially thatthatis caused by TR4.},

   abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum formae specialis cubense (Foc) is a soil-borne fungus that causes Fusarium wilt, which is considered to be the most destructive disease of bananas. The fungus is believed to have evolved with its host in the Indo-Malayan region, and from there it was spread to other banana-growing areas with infected planting material. The diversity and distribution of Foc in Asia was investigated. A total of 594 F. oxysporum isolates collected in ten Asian countries were identified by vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) analysis. To simplify the identification process, the isolates were first divided into DNA lineages using PCR-RFLP analysis. Six lineages and 14 VCGs, representing three Foc races, were identified in this study. The VCG complex 0124/5 was most common in the Indian subcontinent, Vietnam and Cambodia; whereas the VCG complex 01213/16 dominated in the rest of Asia. Sixty-nine F. oxysporum isolates in this study did not match any of the known VCG tester strains. In this study, Foc VCG diversity in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka was determined for the first time and VCGs 01221 and 01222 were first reported from Cambodia and Vietnam. New associations of Foc VCGs and banana cultivars were recorded in all the countries where the fungus was collected. Information obtained in this study could help Asian countries to develop and implement regulatory measures to prevent the incursion of Foc into areas where it does not yet occur. It could also facilitate the deployment of disease resistant banana varieties in infested areas.},

   abstract = {The plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.lycopersici (Fol) has accessory, lineage-specific (LS) chromosomes that can be transferred horizontally between strains. A single LS chromosome in the Fol4287 reference strain harbors all known Fol effector genes. Transfer of this pathogenicity chromosome confers virulence to a previously non-pathogenic recipient strain. We hypothesize that expression and evolution of effector genes is influenced by their genomic context. To gain a better understanding of the genomic context of the effector genes, we manually curated the annotated genes on the pathogenicity chromosome and identified and classified transposable elements. Both retro- and DNA transposons are present with no particular overrepresented class. Retrotransposons appear evenly distributed over the chromosome, while DNA transposons tend to concentrate in large chromosomal subregions. In general, genes on the pathogenicity chromosome are dispersed within the repeat landscape. Effector genes are present within subregions enriched for DNA transposons. A miniature Impala (mimp) is always present in their promoters. Although promoter deletion studies of two effector gene loci did not reveal a direct function of the mimp for gene expression, we were able to use proximity to a mimp as a criterion to identify new effector gene candidates. Through xylem sap proteomics we confirmed that several of these candidates encode proteins secreted during plant infection. Effector genes in Fol reside in characteristic subregions on a pathogenicity chromosome. Their genomic context allowed us to develop a method for the successful identification of novel effector genes. Since our approach is not based on effector gene similarity, but on unique genomic features, it can easily be extended to identify effector genes in Fo strains with different host specificities.},

   abstract = {Plant pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi and oomycetes cause destructive diseases in natural habitats and agricultural settings, thereby threatening plant biodiversity and global food security. The capability of plants to sense and respond to microbial infection determines the outcome of plant–microorganism interactions. Host-adapted microbial pathogens exploit various infection strategies to evade or counter plant immunity and eventually establish a replicative niche. Evasion of plant immunity through dampening host recognition or the subsequent immune signalling and defence execution is a crucial infection strategy used by different microbial pathogens to cause diseases, underpinning a substantial obstacle for efficient deployment of host genetic resistance genes for sustainable disease control. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge of the varied strategies microbial pathogens use to evade the complicated network of plant immunity for successful infection. In addition, we discuss how to exploit this knowledge to engineer crop resistance. In this Review, Wang and colleagues review the strategies microbial pathogens use to evade plant immunity for successful infection. They highlight how microbial effectors manipulate host cellular processes involved in immune sensing, signal integration and defence execution and how to exploit this knowledge to engineer crop resistance.},

Rapidly evolving pathogen effectors play crucial roles in suppressing plant immunity but are also monitored by intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs), leading to effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Here, we review how NLRs recognize effectors with a focus on direct interactions and summarize recent research findings on the signalling functions of NLRs. Coiled-coil (CC)-type NLR proteins execute immune responses by oligomerizing to form membrane-penetrating ion channels after effector recognition. Some CC-NLRs function in sensor-helper networks with the sensor NLR triggering oligomerization of the helper NLR. Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type NLR proteins possess catalytic activities that are activated upon effector recognition-induced oligomerization. Small molecules produced by TIR activity are detected by additional signalling partners of the EDS1 lipase-like family (enhanced disease susceptibility 1), leading to activation of helper NLRs that trigger the defense response.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt of spinach, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, is an important disease during warm conditions in production regions with acid soils, yet little is known about what confers pathogenicity to spinach in F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae genetically. To identify candidate fungal genes that contribute to spinach Fusarium wilt, each of 69 geographically diverse F. oxysporum isolates was tested for pathogenicity on each of three spinach inbreds. Thirty-nine isolates identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae caused quantitative differences in disease severity among the inbreds that revealed two distinct pathogenicity groups of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Putative effector gene profiles, predicted from whole-genome sequences generated for nine F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates and five nonpathogenic, spinach-associated F. oxysporum (NPS) isolates, distinguished the F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates from the NPS isolates, and separated the F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates into two groups. Five of the putative effector genes appeared to be unique to F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, as they were not found in 222 other publicly available genome assemblies of F. oxysporum, implicating potential involvement of these genes in pathogenicity to spinach. In addition, two combinations of the 14 known Secreted in Xylem (SIX) genes that have been affiliated with host pathogenicity in other formae speciales of F. oxysporum were identified in genome assemblies of the nine F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates, either SIX8 and SIX9 or SIX4, SIX8, and SIX14. Characterization of these putative effector genes should aid in understanding mechanisms of pathogenicity in F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, developing molecular tools for rapid detection and quantification of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, and breeding for resistance to Fusarium wilt in spinach.},

A rapid and reliable diagnosis is the foundation of integrated disease management practices in commodity crops. For this diagnostic purpose, we have developed a reliable molecular method to detect Foc race 4 isolates in Taiwan. By PCR amplification, the primer set Foc-1/Foc-2 derived from the sequence of a random primer OP-A02 amplified fragment produced a 242 bp size DNA fragment which was specific to Foc race 4. With the optimized PCR parameters, the molecular method was sensitive and could detect small quantities of Foc DNA as low as 10 pg in 50 to 2,000 ng host genomic DNA with high efficiency. We also demonstrated that by using our PCR assay with Foc-1/Foc-2 primer set, Foc race 4 could be easily distinguished from other Foc races 1 and 2, and separated other formae speciales of F. oxysporum. © 2008 KNPV.},

Hence, the development of simple, reliable and rapid detection technologies is indispensable for implementing quarantine measures. Here, a versatile loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been developed that is applicable under field and laboratory conditions. DNA markers unique to TR4 isolates were obtained by diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArTseq), a genotyping by sequencing technology that was conducted on 27 genotypes, comprising 24 previously reported vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) and three TR4 isolates. The developed LAMP TR4 assay was successfully tested using 22 TR4 isolates and 45 non-target fungal and bacterial isolates, as well as on infected plants under greenhouse and field conditions. The detection limit was 1 pg µL−1 pure TR4 DNA or 102 copies plasmid-localized TR4 unique sequence (SeqA) per reaction, which was not affected by background DNA in complex samples. The LAMP TR4 assay offers a powerful tool for the routine and unambiguous identification of banana plants infected with TR4, contributing to advanced diagnosis in field situations and monitoring of fusarium wilt.},

The implementation of non-contact, highly-efficient, and affordable methods for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests over vast areas could greatly facilitate plant protection. In this respect, different forms of remote sensing methods have been introduced for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests in many ways. This review outlines the state-of-the-art research achievements in relation to sensing technologies, feature extraction, and monitoring algorithms that have been conducted at multiple scales. Based on their characteristics and maturity in detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests, sensing systems are classified into groups that include: visible & near-infrared spectral sensors (VIS-NIR); fluorescence and thermal sensors; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (Lidar) systems. Based on the data acquired from these remote sensing systems and sensitivity analysis, a variety of remote sensing features are proposed and identified as surrogates in the detection and monitoring processes. They include (1) optical, fluorescence, and thermal parameters; (2) image-based landscape features; and (3) features associated with habitat suitability. We also review the algorithms that link the remote sensing features with the occurrence of plant diseases and pests for identifying, differentiating and determining severity of diseases and pests over large areas. The algorithms including statistical discriminant analyses, machine learning algorithms, regression-based models and spectral unmixing algorithms using data collected at a single time or multiple times. Finally, according to the review, we provide a general framework to facilitate the monitoring of an unknown disease or pest highlighting future challenges and trends.},

Results: Large datasets of expert pre-screened banana disease and pest symptom/damage images were collected from various hotspots in Africa and Southern India. To build a detection model, we retrained three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using a transfer learning approach. A total of six different models were developed from 18 different classes (disease by plant parts) using images collected from different parts of the banana plant. Our studies revealed ResNet50 and InceptionV2 based models performed better compared to MobileNetV1.

This significant high success rate makes the model a useful early disease and pest detection tool, and this research could be further extended to develop a fully automated mobile app to help millions of banana farmers in developing countries.},

   abstract = {The disease of banana Fusarium wilt currently threatens banana production areas all over the world. Rapid and large-area monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is very important for the disease treatment and crop planting adjustments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of supervised classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to identify locations that were infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a five-band multi-spectral sensor (blue, green, red, red-edge and near-infrared bands) was used to capture the multi-spectral imagery. A total of 139 ground sample-sites were surveyed to assess the occurrence of banana Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms exhibited good performance for identifying and mapping banana Fusarium wilt disease in UAV-based multi-spectral imagery. The overall accuracies of the SVM, RF, and ANN were 91.4%, 90.0%, and 91.1%, respectively for the pixel-based approach. The RF algorithm required significantly less training time than the SVM and ANN algorithms. The maps generated by the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms showed the areas of occurrence of Fusarium wilt disease were in the range of 5.21-5.75 hm2, accounting for 36.3%-40.1% of the total planting area of bananas in the study area. The results also showed that the inclusion of the red-edge band resulted in an increase in the overall accuracy of 2.9%-3.0%. A simulation of the resolutions of satellite-based imagery (i.e., 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 m resolutions) showed that imagery with a spatial resolution higher than 2 m resulted in good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF classifier is well suited for the identification and mapping of banana Fusarium wilt disease from UAV-based remote sensing imagery. The results provide guidance for disease treatment and crop planting adjustments.},

   abstract = {© 2016 SPIE.Black Sigatoka (BS) is a banana plant disease caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. BS symptoms can be observed at late infection stages. By that time, BS has probably spread to other plants. In this paper, we present our current work on building an hyper-spectral (HS) imaging system aimed at in-vivo detection of BS pre-symptomatic responses in banana leaves. The proposed imaging system comprises a motorized stage, a high-sensitivity VIS-NIR camera and an optical spectrograph. To capture images of the banana leaf, the stage's speed and camera's frame rate must be computed to reduce motion blur and to obtain the same resolution along both spatial dimensions of the resulting HS cube. Our continuous leaf scanning approach allows imaging leaves of arbitrary length with minimum frame loss. Once the images are captured, a denoising step is performed to improve HS image quality and spectral profile extraction.},

   abstract = {<p>Remote sensing through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can potentially be used to identify the factors influencing agricultural yield and thereby increase production efficiency. The use of UAV remains largely underutilised in tropical agricultural systems. In this study we tested a fixed-wing UAV system equipped with a sensor system for mapping spatial patterns of photosynthetic activity in banana plantations in Costa Rica. Spatial patterns derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were compared with spatial patterns of physical soil quality and banana fruit production data. We found spatial patterns of NDVI were significantly positively correlated with spatial patterns of several metrics of fruit yield and quality: bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, length of largest finger, and yield. NDVI was significantly negatively correlated with banana loss (discarded due to low quality). Spatial patterns of NDVI were not correlated with spatial patterns of physical soil quality. These results indicate that UAV systems can be used in banana plantations to help map patterns of fruit quality and yield, potentially aiding investigations of spatial patterns of underlying factors affecting production and thereby helping to increase agricultural efficiency.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) of banana currently threatens banana production areas worldwide. Timely monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is important for the disease treatment and adjustment of banana planting methods. The objective of this study was to establish a method for identifying the banana regions infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt disease using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imagery. Two experiments were conducted in this study. In experiment 1, 120 sample plots were surveyed, of which 75% were used as modeling dataset for model fitting and the remaining were used as validation dataset 1 (VD1) for validation. In experiment 2, 35 sample plots were surveyed, which were used as validation dataset 2 (VD2) for model validation. An UAV equipped with a five band multispectral camera was used to capture the multispectral imagery. Eight vegetation indices (VIs) related to pigment absorption and plant growth changes were chosen for determining the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the plants. The binary logistic regression (BLR) method was used to assess the spatial relationships between the VIs and the plants infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the banana Fusarium wilt disease can be easily identified using the VIs including the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE). The fitting overall accuracies of the models were greater than 80%. Among the investigated VIs, the CIRE exhibited the best performance both for the VD1 (OA = 91.7%, Kappa = 0.83) and VD2 (OA = 80.0%, Kappa = 0.59). For the same type of VI, the VIs including a red-edge band obtained a better performance than that excluding a red-edge band. A simulation of imagery with different spatial resolutions (i.e., 0.5-m, 1-m, 2-m, 5-m, and 10-m resolutions) showed that good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt was obtained when the resolution was higher than 2 m. As the resolution decreased, the identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt showed a decreasing trend. The findings indicate that UAV-based remote sensing with a red-edge band is suitable for identifying banana Fusarium wilt disease. The results of this study provide guidance for detecting the disease and crop planting adjustment.</p>},

   abstract = {The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (Genus: Babuvirus) reduces plant growth and prevents banana production. Because of the very large number of properties with banana plants in South East Queensland, Australia, a mapping approach was developed to delineate individual and clusters of banana plants to help plant identification and enable prioritization of plant inspections for Banana Bunchy Top Virus. Due to current outbreaks in South East Queensland, there are concerns that the virus may spread to the major banana growing districts further north. The mapping approach developed was based on very high spatial resolution airborne orthophotos. Object-based image analysis was used to: (1) detect banana plants using edge and line detection approaches; (2) produce accurate and realistic outlines around classified banana plants; and (3) evaluate the mapping results. The mapping approach was developed based on 10 image tiles of 1 km × 1 km and was applied to orthophotos (3600 image tiles) from September 2011 covering the entire Sunshine Coast Region in South East Queensland. Based on field inspections of the classified maps, a user's mapping accuracy of 88% (n = 146) was achieved. The results will facilitate the detection of banana plants and increase the inspection rate of Banana Bunchy Top Virus in the future.},

   abstract = {The photosynthetic pigments are mainly responsible for absorbing the light intended to promote photosynthesis on the chloroplast of the leaves. Different studies have related the spectral response in the leaves of plants with the biotic stress generated by pathogens. In general, maximum differences in reflectance have been found in the range of 380–750 nm between plants subjected to biotic stress and healthy plants. In this study, it was possible to characterize and relate the spectral variance in leaves of S. lycopersicum infected with F. oxysporum with this physiological variation and pathogen concentration in tomato plants during the asymptomatic period of vascular wilt. Photosynthetic parameters derived from gaseous exchange analysis in the tomato leaves correlated related with four bands in the visible range (Vis). Additionally, five specific bands also present a high correlation with the increase in the concentration of F. oxysporum conidia measured at the root: 448–523 nm, 624–696 nm, 740–960 nm, 973–976 nm, and 992–995 nm. These wavelengths allowed a 100% correct classification of the plants inoculated with F. oxysporum from the plants subjected to hydric stress and the control plants in the asymptomatic period of the disease. The spectral response to biotic and abiotic stress in the measured Vis/NIR range can be explained by the general tendency to change the concentration of chlorophyll and carotene in tomato leaves. These studies also highlight the importance of the implementation of robust multivariate analysis over the multiple univariate analysis used in the applied biological sciences and specifically in the agricultural sciences. These results demonstrate that specific wavelength responses are due to physiological changes in plants subjected to stress, and can be used in indexes and algorithms applied to the early detection of diseases in plants on different pathosystems.},
