   abstract = {The fungus Fusarium oxysporum is infamous for its devastating effects on economically important crops worldwide. F. oxysporum isolates are grouped into formae speciales based on their ability to cause disease on different hosts. Assigning F. oxysporum strains to formae speciales using non-experimental procedures has proven to be challenging due to their genetic heterogeneity and polyphyletic nature. However, genetically diverse isolates of the same forma specialis encode similar repertoires of effectors, proteins that are secreted by the fungus and contribute to the establishment of compatibility with the host. Based on this observation, we previously designed the F. oxysporum Effector Clustering (FoEC) pipeline which is able to classify F. oxysporum strains by forma specialis based on hierarchical clustering of the presence of predicted putative effector sequences, solely using genome assemblies as input. Here we present the updated FoEC2 pipeline which is more user friendly, customizable and, due to multithreading, has improved scalability. It is designed as a Snakemake pipeline and incorporates a new interactive visualization app. We showcase FoEC2 by clustering 537 publicly available F. oxysporum genomes and further analysis of putative effector families as multiple sequence alignments. We confirm classification of isolates into formae speciales and are able to further identify their subtypes. The pipeline is available on github: https://github.com/pvdam3/FoEC2.},

@article{Gutierrez2023,
   abstract = {Fusarium spp. comprise various species of filamentous fungi that cause severe diseases in plant crops of both agricultural and forestry interest. These plant pathogens produce a wide range of molecules with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Genetic functional analyses of some of these compounds have shown their role as virulence factors (VF). However, their mode of action and contributions to the infection process for many of these molecules are still unknown. This review aims to analyze the state of the art in Fusarium VF, emphasizing their biological targets on the plant hosts. It also addresses the current experimental approaches to improve our understanding of their role in virulence and suggests relevant research questions that remain to be answered with a greater focus on species of agroeconomic importance. In this review, a total of 37 confirmed VF are described, including 22 proteinaceous and 15 non-proteinaceous molecules, mainly from Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium graminearum and, to a lesser extent, in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium solani.},

@article{Acuna2022,
   abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), is currently the major threat to the banana industry worldwide (Dita et al. 2018). Restricted to South Asia for more than 20 years, Foc TR4 has spread in the last years to the Middle East, Mozambique, and Colombia (Garc ıa-Bastidas et al. 2020; https://pestdisplace. org/embed/news/map/disease/11). The incursion of Foc TR4 in Colombia increased awareness and prevention efforts across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). However, new Foc TR4 outbreaks in LAC countries were considered inevitable. In April 2021, banana (Musa spp., Cavendish, AAA) plants (30% of incidence) showing typical symptoms of FWB, such as leaf yellowing, wilting, and vascular discoloration, were observed in one farm (about 1 ha) located in Querecotillo, Peru (4 43954.840 S, 80 33945.000 W). Mycological analyses of samples (pseudostem strands) collected from 10 symptomatic plants were performed as described by Dita et al. (2010). These analyses revealed a continuous presence of fungal colonies identified as F. oxysporum species complex. Molecular diagnostics targeting two different genome regions (Dita et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013) identified nine of these isolates as Foc TR4. These results were further confirmed by qPCR analyses using the commercial Clear Detections TR4 kit. The genomes of four single-spore isolates (PerS1, PerS2, PerS3, and PerS4) were sequenced using the Illumina platform (MiSeq Kit, 2x151 bp Paired-End). The strain PerS4 was also sequenced using Oxford Nanopore (FLOW-MIN111; R10.3 chemistry) as described by L opez-Alvarez et al. (2020). The generated draft assembly yielded 533 contigs for a size of 47 Mbp (BioProject: PRJNA755905), which is comparable with sizes of previously reported Foc TR4 strains (Asai et al. 2019; Garc ıa-Bastidas et al. 2020; Maymon et al. 2020; Warmington et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2018). The sequence assembly showed high contiguity (94.9%) and high similarity (95.48%) with the high-quality genome sequence of the Foc TR4 isolate 'UK0001' (Warmington et al. 2019). Further analyses to identify the presence/absence of full sequences for the putative effector genes (Secreted in Xylem-SIX) and their allelic copies also revealed that the SIX gene profiles of the strains isolated from Querecotillo matched with previously reported Foc TR4 isolates (Czislowski et al. 2017). Pathogenicity tests with three isolates and water controls were performed as described by Dita et al. (2010), using five Cavendish plantlets per treatment. Four weeks after the inoculation, typical external and internal symptoms of FWB were observed only in the inoculated plants. Fungal isolates recovered from inocu-lated plants tested positive for Foc TR4 when analyzed with PCR diagnostics as mentioned above. No fungal isolates were recovered from water-control plants, which did not show any symptoms. Altogether, our results confirm the first incursion of Foc TR4 in Peru. Currently, Foc TR4 has the phytosani-tary status of a present pest with restricted distribution in Peru, and it is under official control of the National Plant Protection Organization-SENASA. Reinforced prevention and quarantine measures, disease monitoring, and capacity building to detect, contain and manage eventual new outbreaks of Foc TR4 are strongly encouraged across LAC banana-producing countries, especially those bordering Peru with larger banana plantations, such as Ecua-dor and Brazil.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is an important disease of banana in almost all banana-producing countries of the world. The recent occurrence of a highly virulent form of Foc in Asia, known as 'tropical race 4' (TR4), presents an imminent threat to the region's Cavendish-based banana industries. Foc-TR4 has caused severe damage to the Cavendish banana industry of Taiwan since 1967, destroyed new plantations of Cavendish banana in Indonesia and Malaysia since the early 1990s and caused field epidemics in the Northern Territory of Australia between 1997 and 1999. In 2004, severe Foc infection in banana plantations in Guangdong province, South China, heightened the TR4 threat. All outbreaks are associated with the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) complex 1213/16. Historical field observations of Foc in Cavendish banana cultivars in the Philippines since 1970 are described. More than 30,000 individual reports of infection were officially recorded in the Philippines from 1974 to 1991. These infections were tested and identified as VCG 0122, 0123 and 0126, which are believed to be less virulent than the VCG 01213/16 complex. In September 2006, 30 infected plant samples were collected from highland and lowland Cavendish banana farms in Davao. These samples confirmed that the recent outbreaks of Fusarium wilt in Cavendish in the Philippines were caused by the VCG 01213/16 complex. The Philippine government, private banana companies and Bioversity International are collaborating to manage the disease and to try to contain further spread of Foc-TR4.},

Race 4 affects cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the subtropics, as well as race 1 and race 2 suscepts. It has caused concern in the tropically based export trades which depend almost entirely on the Cavendish clones. Attention is also drawn to affected non‐exported bananas which are important cash crops or staple foods. Although they are not as well documented as those on the Cavendish subgroup, epidemics of the disease on non‐exported bananas are far more important. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Banana (Musa spp.) is one of the world's most important fruits. In 2011, 145 million metric tons, worth an estimated $44 billion, were produced in over 130 countries. Fusarium wilt (also known as Panama disease) is one of the most destructive diseases of this crop. It devastated the 'Gros Michel'-based export trades before the mid-1900s, and threatens the Cavendish cultivars that were used to replace it; in total, the latter cultivars are now responsible for approximately 45% of all production. An overview of the disease and its causal agent, Fusarium oxysporum f. Sp. Cubense, is presented below. Despite a substantial positive literature on biological, chemical, or cultural measures, management is largely restricted to excluding F. oxysporum f. Sp. Cubense from noninfested areas and using resistant cultivars where the pathogen has established. Resistance to Fusarium wilt is poor in several breeding targets, including important dessert and cooking cultivars. Better resistance to this and other diseases is needed. The history and impact of Fusarium wilt is summarized with an emphasis on tropical race 4 (TR4), a 'Cavendish'-killing variant of the pathogen that has spread dramatically in the Eastern Hemisphere.},

Fusarium wilt, which is also known as Panama disease, is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). It is one of the most destructive diseases of this crop, and has a relatively wide host range. Its greatest impact was on the early 'Gros Michel'-based export trades. Resistant cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup were used to replace 'Gros Michel,' but are now succumbing to a new variant of the pathogen, tropical race 4 (TR4). Although TR4 is only found in the Eastern Hemisphere, it threatens global export and small-holder production of the Cavendish cultivars. Management of this disease is largely restricted to excluding the pathogen from non-infested areas and the use of resistant cultivars where Foc is established. The perennial production of this crop and the polycyclic nature of this disease hinder the development of other management strategies. Measures that are effective against annual or short-lived hosts of these diseases are usually ineffective against Fusarium wilt of banana. Effective biological, chemical and cultural measures are not available, despite a substantial, positive literature on these topics. Critical evaluations of, and realistic expectations for, these measures are needed. Better resistance is needed to this disease, especially thatthatis caused by TR4.},

   abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum formae specialis cubense (Foc) is a soil-borne fungus that causes Fusarium wilt, which is considered to be the most destructive disease of bananas. The fungus is believed to have evolved with its host in the Indo-Malayan region, and from there it was spread to other banana-growing areas with infected planting material. The diversity and distribution of Foc in Asia was investigated. A total of 594 F. oxysporum isolates collected in ten Asian countries were identified by vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) analysis. To simplify the identification process, the isolates were first divided into DNA lineages using PCR-RFLP analysis. Six lineages and 14 VCGs, representing three Foc races, were identified in this study. The VCG complex 0124/5 was most common in the Indian subcontinent, Vietnam and Cambodia; whereas the VCG complex 01213/16 dominated in the rest of Asia. Sixty-nine F. oxysporum isolates in this study did not match any of the known VCG tester strains. In this study, Foc VCG diversity in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka was determined for the first time and VCGs 01221 and 01222 were first reported from Cambodia and Vietnam. New associations of Foc VCGs and banana cultivars were recorded in all the countries where the fungus was collected. Information obtained in this study could help Asian countries to develop and implement regulatory measures to prevent the incursion of Foc into areas where it does not yet occur. It could also facilitate the deployment of disease resistant banana varieties in infested areas.},

   abstract = {The plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.lycopersici (Fol) has accessory, lineage-specific (LS) chromosomes that can be transferred horizontally between strains. A single LS chromosome in the Fol4287 reference strain harbors all known Fol effector genes. Transfer of this pathogenicity chromosome confers virulence to a previously non-pathogenic recipient strain. We hypothesize that expression and evolution of effector genes is influenced by their genomic context. To gain a better understanding of the genomic context of the effector genes, we manually curated the annotated genes on the pathogenicity chromosome and identified and classified transposable elements. Both retro- and DNA transposons are present with no particular overrepresented class. Retrotransposons appear evenly distributed over the chromosome, while DNA transposons tend to concentrate in large chromosomal subregions. In general, genes on the pathogenicity chromosome are dispersed within the repeat landscape. Effector genes are present within subregions enriched for DNA transposons. A miniature Impala (mimp) is always present in their promoters. Although promoter deletion studies of two effector gene loci did not reveal a direct function of the mimp for gene expression, we were able to use proximity to a mimp as a criterion to identify new effector gene candidates. Through xylem sap proteomics we confirmed that several of these candidates encode proteins secreted during plant infection. Effector genes in Fol reside in characteristic subregions on a pathogenicity chromosome. Their genomic context allowed us to develop a method for the successful identification of novel effector genes. Since our approach is not based on effector gene similarity, but on unique genomic features, it can easily be extended to identify effector genes in Fo strains with different host specificities.},

The capability of plants to sense and respond to microbial infection determines the outcome of plant–microorganism interactions. Host-adapted microbial pathogens exploit various infection strategies to evade or counter plant immunity and eventually establish a replicative niche. Evasion of plant immunity through dampening host recognition or the subsequent immune signalling and defence execution is a crucial infection strategy used by different microbial pathogens to cause diseases, underpinning a substantial obstacle for efficient deployment of host genetic resistance genes for sustainable disease control. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge of the varied strategies microbial pathogens use to evade the complicated network of plant immunity for successful infection. In addition, we discuss how to exploit this knowledge to engineer crop resistance. In this Review, Wang and colleagues review the strategies microbial pathogens use to evade plant immunity for successful infection. They highlight how microbial effectors manipulate host cellular processes involved in immune sensing, signal integration and defence execution and how to exploit this knowledge to engineer crop resistance.},

Rapidly evolving pathogen effectors play crucial roles in suppressing plant immunity but are also monitored by intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs), leading to effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Here, we review how NLRs recognize effectors with a focus on direct interactions and summarize recent research findings on the signalling functions of NLRs. Coiled-coil (CC)-type NLR proteins execute immune responses by oligomerizing to form membrane-penetrating ion channels after effector recognition. Some CC-NLRs function in sensor-helper networks with the sensor NLR triggering oligomerization of the helper NLR. Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type NLR proteins possess catalytic activities that are activated upon effector recognition-induced oligomerization. Small molecules produced by TIR activity are detected by additional signalling partners of the EDS1 lipase-like family (enhanced disease susceptibility 1), leading to activation of helper NLRs that trigger the defense response.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt of spinach, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, is an important disease during warm conditions in production regions with acid soils, yet little is known about what confers pathogenicity to spinach in F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae genetically. To identify candidate fungal genes that contribute to spinach Fusarium wilt, each of 69 geographically diverse F. oxysporum isolates was tested for pathogenicity on each of three spinach inbreds. Thirty-nine isolates identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae caused quantitative differences in disease severity among the inbreds that revealed two distinct pathogenicity groups of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Putative effector gene profiles, predicted from whole-genome sequences generated for nine F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates and five nonpathogenic, spinach-associated F. oxysporum (NPS) isolates, distinguished the F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates from the NPS isolates, and separated the F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates into two groups. Five of the putative effector genes appeared to be unique to F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, as they were not found in 222 other publicly available genome assemblies of F. oxysporum, implicating potential involvement of these genes in pathogenicity to spinach. In addition, two combinations of the 14 known Secreted in Xylem (SIX) genes that have been affiliated with host pathogenicity in other formae speciales of F. oxysporum were identified in genome assemblies of the nine F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates, either SIX8 and SIX9 or SIX4, SIX8, and SIX14. Characterization of these putative effector genes should aid in understanding mechanisms of pathogenicity in F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, developing molecular tools for rapid detection and quantification of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, and breeding for resistance to Fusarium wilt in spinach.},

By PCR amplification, the primer set Foc-1/Foc-2 derived from the sequence of a random primer OP-A02 amplified fragment produced a 242 bp size DNA fragment which was specific to Foc race 4. With the optimized PCR parameters, the molecular method was sensitive and could detect small quantities of Foc DNA as low as 10 pg in 50 to 2,000 ng host genomic DNA with high efficiency. We also demonstrated that by using our PCR assay with Foc-1/Foc-2 primer set, Foc race 4 could be easily distinguished from other Foc races 1 and 2, and separated other formae speciales of F. oxysporum. © 2008 KNPV.},

Hence, the development of simple, reliable and rapid detection technologies is indispensable for implementing quarantine measures. Here, a versatile loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been developed that is applicable under field and laboratory conditions. DNA markers unique to TR4 isolates were obtained by diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArTseq), a genotyping by sequencing technology that was conducted on 27 genotypes, comprising 24 previously reported vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) and three TR4 isolates. The developed LAMP TR4 assay was successfully tested using 22 TR4 isolates and 45 non-target fungal and bacterial isolates, as well as on infected plants under greenhouse and field conditions. The detection limit was 1 pg µL−1 pure TR4 DNA or 102 copies plasmid-localized TR4 unique sequence (SeqA) per reaction, which was not affected by background DNA in complex samples. The LAMP TR4 assay offers a powerful tool for the routine and unambiguous identification of banana plants infected with TR4, contributing to advanced diagnosis in field situations and monitoring of fusarium wilt.},

The implementation of non-contact, highly-efficient, and affordable methods for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests over vast areas could greatly facilitate plant protection. In this respect, different forms of remote sensing methods have been introduced for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests in many ways. This review outlines the state-of-the-art research achievements in relation to sensing technologies, feature extraction, and monitoring algorithms that have been conducted at multiple scales. Based on their characteristics and maturity in detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests, sensing systems are classified into groups that include: visible & near-infrared spectral sensors (VIS-NIR); fluorescence and thermal sensors; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (Lidar) systems. Based on the data acquired from these remote sensing systems and sensitivity analysis, a variety of remote sensing features are proposed and identified as surrogates in the detection and monitoring processes. They include (1) optical, fluorescence, and thermal parameters; (2) image-based landscape features; and (3) features associated with habitat suitability. We also review the algorithms that link the remote sensing features with the occurrence of plant diseases and pests for identifying, differentiating and determining severity of diseases and pests over large areas. The algorithms including statistical discriminant analyses, machine learning algorithms, regression-based models and spectral unmixing algorithms using data collected at a single time or multiple times.

   abstract = {Background: Banana (Musa spp.) is the most popular marketable fruit crop grown all over the world, and a dominant staple food in many developing countries. Worldwide, banana production is affected by numerous diseases and pests. Novel and rapid methods for the timely detection of pests and diseases will allow to surveil and develop control measures with greater efficiency. As deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and transfer learning has been successfully applied in various fields, it has freshly moved in the domain of just-in-time crop disease detection. The aim of this research is to develop an AI-based banana disease and pest detection system using a DCNN to support banana farmers. Results: Large datasets of expert pre-screened banana disease and pest symptom/damage images were collected from various hotspots in Africa and Southern India. To build a detection model, we retrained three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using a transfer learning approach. A total of six different models were developed from 18 different classes (disease by plant parts) using images collected from different parts of the banana plant. Our studies revealed ResNet50 and InceptionV2 based models performed better compared to MobileNetV1. These architectures represent the state-of-the-art results of banana diseases and pest detection with an accuracy of more than 90% in most of the models tested. These experimental results were comparable with other state-of-the-art models found in the literature. With a future view to run these detection capabilities on a mobile device, we evaluated the performance of SSD (single shot detector) MobileNetV1. Performance and validation metrics were also computed to measure the accuracy of different models in automated disease detection methods. Conclusion: Our results showed that the DCNN was a robust and easily deployable strategy for digital banana disease and pest detection. Using a pre-trained disease recognition model, we were able to perform deep transfer learning (DTL) to produce a network that can make accurate predictions. This significant high success rate makes the model a useful early disease and pest detection tool, and this research could be further extended to develop a fully automated mobile app to help millions of banana farmers in developing countries.},

   abstract = {The disease of banana Fusarium wilt currently threatens banana production areas all over the world. Rapid and large-area monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is very important for the disease treatment and crop planting adjustments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of supervised classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to identify locations that were infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a five-band multi-spectral sensor (blue, green, red, red-edge and near-infrared bands) was used to capture the multi-spectral imagery. A total of 139 ground sample-sites were surveyed to assess the occurrence of banana Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms exhibited good performance for identifying and mapping banana Fusarium wilt disease in UAV-based multi-spectral imagery. The overall accuracies of the SVM, RF, and ANN were 91.4%, 90.0%, and 91.1%, respectively for the pixel-based approach. The RF algorithm required significantly less training time than the SVM and ANN algorithms. The maps generated by the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms showed the areas of occurrence of Fusarium wilt disease were in the range of 5.21-5.75 hm2, accounting for 36.3%-40.1% of the total planting area of bananas in the study area. The results also showed that the inclusion of the red-edge band resulted in an increase in the overall accuracy of 2.9%-3.0%. A simulation of the resolutions of satellite-based imagery (i.e., 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 m resolutions) showed that imagery with a spatial resolution higher than 2 m resulted in good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF classifier is well suited for the identification and mapping of banana Fusarium wilt disease from UAV-based remote sensing imagery. The results provide guidance for disease treatment and crop planting adjustments.},

   abstract = {© 2016 SPIE.Black Sigatoka (BS) is a banana plant disease caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. BS symptoms can be observed at late infection stages. By that time, BS has probably spread to other plants. In this paper, we present our current work on building an hyper-spectral (HS) imaging system aimed at in-vivo detection of BS pre-symptomatic responses in banana leaves. The proposed imaging system comprises a motorized stage, a high-sensitivity VIS-NIR camera and an optical spectrograph. To capture images of the banana leaf, the stage's speed and camera's frame rate must be computed to reduce motion blur and to obtain the same resolution along both spatial dimensions of the resulting HS cube. Our continuous leaf scanning approach allows imaging leaves of arbitrary length with minimum frame loss. Once the images are captured, a denoising step is performed to improve HS image quality and spectral profile extraction.},

   abstract = {<p>Remote sensing through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can potentially be used to identify the factors influencing agricultural yield and thereby increase production efficiency. The use of UAV remains largely underutilised in tropical agricultural systems. In this study we tested a fixed-wing UAV system equipped with a sensor system for mapping spatial patterns of photosynthetic activity in banana plantations in Costa Rica. Spatial patterns derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were compared with spatial patterns of physical soil quality and banana fruit production data. We found spatial patterns of NDVI were significantly positively correlated with spatial patterns of several metrics of fruit yield and quality: bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, length of largest finger, and yield. NDVI was significantly negatively correlated with banana loss (discarded due to low quality). Spatial patterns of NDVI were not correlated with spatial patterns of physical soil quality. These results indicate that UAV systems can be used in banana plantations to help map patterns of fruit quality and yield, potentially aiding investigations of spatial patterns of underlying factors affecting production and thereby helping to increase agricultural efficiency.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) of banana currently threatens banana production areas worldwide. Timely monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is important for the disease treatment and adjustment of banana planting methods. The objective of this study was to establish a method for identifying the banana regions infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt disease using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imagery. Two experiments were conducted in this study. In experiment 1, 120 sample plots were surveyed, of which 75% were used as modeling dataset for model fitting and the remaining were used as validation dataset 1 (VD1) for validation. In experiment 2, 35 sample plots were surveyed, which were used as validation dataset 2 (VD2) for model validation. An UAV equipped with a five band multispectral camera was used to capture the multispectral imagery. Eight vegetation indices (VIs) related to pigment absorption and plant growth changes were chosen for determining the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the plants. The binary logistic regression (BLR) method was used to assess the spatial relationships between the VIs and the plants infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the banana Fusarium wilt disease can be easily identified using the VIs including the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE). The fitting overall accuracies of the models were greater than 80%. Among the investigated VIs, the CIRE exhibited the best performance both for the VD1 (OA = 91.7%, Kappa = 0.83) and VD2 (OA = 80.0%, Kappa = 0.59). For the same type of VI, the VIs including a red-edge band obtained a better performance than that excluding a red-edge band. A simulation of imagery with different spatial resolutions (i.e., 0.5-m, 1-m, 2-m, 5-m, and 10-m resolutions) showed that good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt was obtained when the resolution was higher than 2 m. As the resolution decreased, the identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt showed a decreasing trend. The findings indicate that UAV-based remote sensing with a red-edge band is suitable for identifying banana Fusarium wilt disease. The results of this study provide guidance for detecting the disease and crop planting adjustment.</p>},

   abstract = {The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (Genus: Babuvirus) reduces plant growth and prevents banana production. Because of the very large number of properties with banana plants in South East Queensland, Australia, a mapping approach was developed to delineate individual and clusters of banana plants to help plant identification and enable prioritization of plant inspections for Banana Bunchy Top Virus. Due to current outbreaks in South East Queensland, there are concerns that the virus may spread to the major banana growing districts further north. The mapping approach developed was based on very high spatial resolution airborne orthophotos. Object-based image analysis was used to: (1) detect banana plants using edge and line detection approaches; (2) produce accurate and realistic outlines around classified banana plants; and (3) evaluate the mapping results. The mapping approach was developed based on 10 image tiles of 1 km × 1 km and was applied to orthophotos (3600 image tiles) from September 2011 covering the entire Sunshine Coast Region in South East Queensland. Based on field inspections of the classified maps, a user's mapping accuracy of 88% (n = 146) was achieved. The results will facilitate the detection of banana plants and increase the inspection rate of Banana Bunchy Top Virus in the future.},

   abstract = {The photosynthetic pigments are mainly responsible for absorbing the light intended to promote photosynthesis on the chloroplast of the leaves. Different studies have related the spectral response in the leaves of plants with the biotic stress generated by pathogens. In general, maximum differences in reflectance have been found in the range of 380–750 nm between plants subjected to biotic stress and healthy plants. In this study, it was possible to characterize and relate the spectral variance in leaves of S. lycopersicum infected with F. oxysporum with this physiological variation and pathogen concentration in tomato plants during the asymptomatic period of vascular wilt. Photosynthetic parameters derived from gaseous exchange analysis in the tomato leaves correlated related with four bands in the visible range (Vis). Additionally, five specific bands also present a high correlation with the increase in the concentration of F. oxysporum conidia measured at the root: 448–523 nm, 624–696 nm, 740–960 nm, 973–976 nm, and 992–995 nm. These wavelengths allowed a 100% correct classification of the plants inoculated with F. oxysporum from the plants subjected to hydric stress and the control plants in the asymptomatic period of the disease. The spectral response to biotic and abiotic stress in the measured Vis/NIR range can be explained by the general tendency to change the concentration of chlorophyll and carotene in tomato leaves. These studies also highlight the importance of the implementation of robust multivariate analysis over the multiple univariate analysis used in the applied biological sciences and specifically in the agricultural sciences. These results demonstrate that specific wavelength responses are due to physiological changes in plants subjected to stress, and can be used in indexes and algorithms applied to the early detection of diseases in plants on different pathosystems.},

   abstract = {This Research Topic contains a selection of papers dealing with Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), also known as Panama disease, that investigate (i) the epidemiology, distribution, infection biology, and diversity of the pathogen, (ii) management practices, and (iii) ways to identify and screen for resistance. The Research Topic arose from the increasing spread and the growing global impact of FWB, affecting a wide range of banana production systems worldwide. During the inception of this Research Topic an increased understanding of genetic diversity of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc), traditionally considered as the causal agent of FWB, emerged and showed that Foc comprises several different Fusarium species (Ploetz, 2006; Maryani et al., 2019). The so-called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) was found to be genetically distant from other FWB causing species and was described as Fusarium odoratissimum (Maryani et al., 2019). Different strains of this Fusarium species have affected banana production worldwide. Prior to the 1960s, the spread of FWB was primarily caused by so-called Race 1 strains that caused severe losses in the production and export trade in Latin America, which was based almost entirely on the highly susceptible cultivar Gros Michel. The failing management of FWB in Gros Michel eventually convinced the export companies to convert the business to resistant Cavendish cultivars. TR4 first emerged in Southeast Asia (Ploetz, 1990) and its current rapid spread was analyzed by Ordonez et al. (2015). Subsequent studies showed that the TR4 strain is extremely virulent toward many banana cultivars, including Cavendish cultivars grown in large-scale monoculture plantations for export markets and many banana varieties important for food security and domestic consumption. There are no readily available solutions to manage this disease. Moreover, this global threat connects export trade, strongly dependent on the susceptible Cavendish cultivars, to local production systems wherein a range of banana varieties contributing to food security are also impacted. This Research Topic aims to provide a platform for information exchange and knowledge sharing. The contributions demonstrate an active research community in search of effective control of FWB. Taken together, the papers provide an overview of our current understanding of the Kema et al. Editorial: Fusarium Wilt Threatens Banana Production biology and epidemiology of TR4, its management and how integrated and innovative solutions are required and need to be embraced by all stakeholders in an effort to build a sustainable banana industry for the future.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is an important disease of banana in almost all banana-producing countries of the world. The recent occurrence of a highly virulent form of Foc in Asia, known as 'tropical race 4' (TR4), presents an imminent threat to the region's Cavendish-based banana industries. Foc-TR4 has caused severe damage to the Cavendish banana industry of Taiwan since 1967, destroyed new plantations of Cavendish banana in Indonesia and Malaysia since the early 1990s and caused field epidemics in the Northern Territory of Australia between 1997 and 1999. In 2004, severe Foc infection in banana plantations in Guangdong province, South China, heightened the TR4 threat. All outbreaks are associated with the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) complex 1213/16. Historical field observations of Foc in Cavendish banana cultivars in the Philippines since 1970 are described. More than 30,000 individual reports of infection were officially recorded in the Philippines from 1974 to 1991. These infections were tested and identified as VCG 0122, 0123 and 0126, which are believed to be less virulent than the VCG 01213/16 complex. In September 2006, 30 infected plant samples were collected from highland and lowland Cavendish banana farms in Davao. These samples confirmed that the recent outbreaks of Fusarium wilt in Cavendish in the Philippines were caused by the VCG 01213/16 complex. The Philippine government, private banana companies and Bioversity International are collaborating to manage the disease and to try to contain further spread of Foc-TR4.},

Despite its importance and the presence of serious disease threats, research into this crop is limited. One of those is Panama disease or Fusarium wilt. In the previous century Fusarium wilt wiped out the “Gros Michel” based banana industry in Central America. The epidemic was eventually quenched by planting “Cavendish” bananas. However, 50 years ago the disease recurred, but now on “Cavendish” bananas. Since then the disease has spread across South-East Asia, to the Middle-East and the Indian subcontinent and leaped into Africa. Here, we report the presence of Fusariumoxysporumf.sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4) in “Cavendish” plantations in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. A combination of classical morphology, DNA sequencing, and phenotyping assays revealed a very close relationship between the Foc TR4 strains in the entire Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which is increasingly prone to intensive banana production. Analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms enabled us to initiate a phylogeography of Foc TR4 across three geographical areas—GMS, Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East revealing three distinct Foc TR4 sub-lineages. Collectively, our data place these new incursions in a broader agroecological context and underscore the need for awareness campaigns and the implementation of validated quarantine measures to prevent further international dissemination of Foc TR4.},

   abstract = {Panama disease of banana, caused byFusarium oxysporumf. sp.cubense(Foc), poses a great risk to global banana production. Tropical race 4 (TR4) of Foc, which affects Cavendish bananas as well as many other banana cultivars (Ploetz 2006), was confirmed for the first time outside Southeast Asia in Jordan in 2013 (García-Bastidas et al. 2014). In Pakistan, bananas are produced in the Sindh and Balochistan provinces (91% [31,000 ha] and 9% of the country’s production, respectively). Symptoms ofFusariumwilt, including wilting of leaves and vascular discoloration in rhizomes and pseudostems, were first observed in 2012 in a 2-ha Cavendish plantation in Baoo Pooran (ca. 24°N, 68°E), Sindh Province. By January 2014, approximately 121 ha were affected. In Lebanon, bananas are produced for local consumption and regional export, especially to Syria. Yellowing of leaves and internal vascular discoloration in the pseudostems was first observed in Cavendish plants in October 2013 in the Mansouri and Berghliyeh regions. Thus far, 1 ha has been affected. Infected pseudostem tissue samples from Pakistan and Lebanon were processed for Foc isolation and characterization as described byGarcía-Bastidas et al. (2014). White colonies developed from the surface sterilized (70% ethanol) tissue on Komada’s medium (Leslie and Summerell 2006) and nine single microconidia isolates were generated, four from the Pakistan sample and five from the Lebanon samples and transferred to quarter-strength PDA. All isolates phenotypically resembledF. oxysporum(Leslie and Summerell 2006) and were diagnosed as vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 01213, which was confirmed by PCR, thereby corroborating that VCG01213 only represents TR4 strains (Ploetz 2006). Subsequently, one of the isolates from Pakistan (Pak1.1A) and one isolate each from Mansouri (Leb1.1A) and Berghliyeh (Leb1.2C) in Lebanon were analyzed for pathogenicity. Inoculum production and inoculation were according toDita et al. (2010)by dipping (30 min, 106spores/ml) root-wounded 10-week-old Cavendish cv. Grand Naine plants, which were then placed in sand in 3-liter pots under 28°C, 70% relative humidity, and a 16-h diurnal light periods for 6 weeks. Sets of three plants were each treated with either Pak1.1A, Leb1.1A, Leb1.2C, or TR4 (reference isolate II-5, which was diagnosed as TR4 by PCR and pathogenicity analyses, seeDita et al. 2010). Control sets were each treated with either Foc Race1 (Cruz das Almas, Brazil, seeDita et al. 2010) or water. After 4 weeks, all plants inoculated with the isolates from Pakistan, Lebanon, and TR4 (II-5) produced typical symptoms of Fusarium wilt. After 6 weeks, internal symptoms were recorded and tissue was collected from all plants and plated on Komada’s medium. TR4 was confirmed by PCR from isolates that were recovered from all symptomatic plants. No isolates were recovered from plants infected with Race 1 or the water controls, all of which remained asymptomatic. Thus, we confirm the presence of TR4 in Pakistan and Lebanon and its continued expansion and distribution in Western Asia. Although comparatively limited production areas have been affected to date, increasing damage will undoubtedly occur in these countries in the near future.},

   abstract = {Background: Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies.Results: We present MAKER2, a genome annotation and data management tool designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded, parallelized application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes where training-data are limited, of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2 also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations, significantly improving their quality. We also show that MAKER2 can evaluate the quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic annotations for manual review.Conclusions: MAKER2 is the first annotation engine specifically designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 scales to datasets of any size, requires little in the way of training data, and can use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality. It can also update and manage legacy genome annotation datasets. © 2011 Holt and Yandell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Additionally, with the emergence of new algorithms and data types, tools that can improve the quality of existing assemblies through automated and manual curation are required. Results: We sought to address both these needs by developing gfastats, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) effort to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale. Gfastats is a standalone tool to compute assembly summary statistics and manipulate assembly sequences in FASTA, FASTQ or GFA [.gz] format. Gfastats stores assembly sequences internally in a GFA-like format. This feature allows gfastats to seamlessly convert FAST∗ to and from GFA [.gz] files. Gfastats can also build an assembly graph that can in turn be used to manipulate the underlying sequences following instructions provided by the user, while simultaneously generating key metrics for the new sequences.},

Since January 2013, registration of fungal names is a mandatory requirement for valid publication under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN). This review explains the database innovations that have been implemented over the past few years, and discusses new features such as advanced queries, registration of typification events (MBT numbers for lecto, epi- and neotypes), the multi-lingual database interface, the nomenclature discussion forum, annotation system, and web services with links to third parties. MycoBank has also introduced novel identifcation services, linking DNAsequence data to numerous related databases to enable intelligent search queries. Although MycoBank flls an important void for taxon registration, challenges for the future remain to improve links between taxonomic names and DNA data, and to also introduce a formal system for naming fungi known from DNA sequence data only. To further improve the quality of MycoBank data, remote access will now allow registered mycologists to act as MycoBank curators, using Citrix software.},

These genomic compartments also exhibit distinct gene densities and compositional characteristics with respect to other genomic partitions, and likely play a role in the generation of molecular diversity. Our data provide additional evidence that gene duplication, divergence, and differential loss play important roles in F. fujikuroi genome evolution and suggest that hundreds of lineage-specific genes might have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer.},

Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense is the agent of wilt disease in banana plantlets and four races of the pathogen have been identified based on the cultivar specificity. A total of 9 SIX genes have been detected in the genome of Foc TR4 and 6 genes detected in Foc1. Among these SIX genes, SIX2 and SIX8 are only detected in Foc TR4, not identified in Foc1. Expression profiles analysis revealed that SIX genes of Foc TR4 are highly induced after inoculation to Cavendish banana plantlets. Virulence analysis of the SIX2 and SIX8 knock-out mutants showed that SIX8 is required for the virulence of Foc TR4 while SIX2 has no obvious functions. Over expression of SIX8-FLAG proteins in the SIX8 knock-out mutant partly restored the virulence. Western blot analysis suggested that SIX8 could be secreted into the extracellular space and a signal peptide resided the N-terminal polypeptide sequence. This study provides some clues for further research on mechanism of SIX8 in regulating virulence of Foc TR4.},

The low costs and increasing efficiency of sequencing technologies now enable assembling genomes at unprecedented quality and contiguity. However, the difficulty in assembling repeat-rich and GC-rich regions (genomic “dark matter”) limits insights into the evolution of genome structure and regulatory networks. Here, we compare the efficiency of currently available sequencing technologies (short/linked/long reads and proximity ligation maps) and combinations thereof in assembling genomic dark matter. By adopting different de novo assembly strategies, we compare individual draft assemblies to a curated multiplatform reference assembly and identify the genomic features that cause gaps within each assembly. We show that a multiplatform assembly implementing long-read, linked-read and proximity sequencing technologies performs best at recovering transposable elements, multicopy MHC genes, GC-rich microchromosomes and the repeat-rich W chromosome. Telomere-to-telomere assemblies are not a reality yet for most organisms, but by leveraging technology choice it is now possible to minimize genome assembly gaps for downstream analysis. We provide a roadmap to tailor sequencing projects for optimized completeness of both the coding and noncoding parts of nonmodel genomes.},

Repeats have always presented technical challenges for sequence alignment and assembly programs. Next-generation sequencing projects, with their short read lengths and high data volumes, have made these challenges more difficult. From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

   abstract = {Societal Impact Statement: Bananas are the world's most popular dessert fruit and a staple starch crop for millions in low- and middle-income countries. The banana export trade that supplies North America, Europe, and other wealthy nations has a history fraught with exploitation and conflict. The price of cheap bananas has been environmental degradation, violence, and poverty. Only recently have efforts to address the power imbalances in this trade been made. Voluntary certification schemes aim to address multiple sustainability issues, while research into biological control, accelerated plant breeding, and efficient irrigation will help prepare the industry for emerging threats from pests, diseases, and climate change. Summary: Bananas are the world's favorite dessert fruit, a staple starch crop for millions, and an important source of income for producers across the tropics and subtropics. Bananas evolved and diversified as giant perennial herbs of open habitats within the humid forests of Southeast Asia and West Oceania and were domesticated around 7000 years BP through a series of hybridization events. This review considers the journey from rainforest riversides to intensively managed monoculture plantations, focussing on the Cavendish banana that comprises nearly the entire global export trade. Climate change increasingly threatens economic sustainability in several major producer regions, requiring responses such as efficient irrigation systems to maintain productivity and water security. Pests and diseases are spreading globally and have severe direct impacts on production as well as indirect impacts via harm to ecological and human health caused by pesticides. New pest and disease management methods employing biological controls and enhancing soil health and new plant breeding techniques must be developed and implemented. The banana production and trade system has been characterized by power imbalances between international firms that own plantations and supply the market and the local agricultural workers who cultivate and harvest the fruit. Voluntary certification schemes have been developed to address the numerous environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues faced by the industry. There are indications, from research on biological disease control to new deals on wages and benefits for banana workers, that change is slowly coming to the global banana trade.},

   abstract = {Banana production in Eastern Africa is threatened by the presence of a new devastating bacterial disease caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (formerly Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum). The disease has been identified in Uganda, Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania. Disease symptoms include wilting and yellowing of leaves, excretion of a yellowish bacterial ooze, premature ripening of the bunch, rotting of fruit and internal yellow discolorationof the vascular bundles. Plants are infected either by insects through the inflorescence or by soil-borne bacterial inoculum through the lower parts of the plant. Short- and long-distance transmission of thedisease mainly occurs via contaminated tools and insects, though other organisms such as birds may also be involved. Although no banana cultivar with resistance to the disease has been identified as yet,it appears that certain cultivars have mechanisms to ‘escape’ the disease. Management and control of the disease involve methods that reduce the inoculum’s density and spread of the pathogen. Removalof the male bud (de-budding) has proven to be very effective in preventing the disease incidence since the male bud appears to be the primary infection site. The economic impact of banana Xanthomonaswilt is not fully understood but its impact on food security in the region is very significant. While germplasm screening for the disease is ongoing, efforts to genetically engineer resistance in somebanana cultivars are also making good progress. This paper presents a review of the disease and management strategies that have been successful in curtailing its spread.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease encompasses a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (or NASH), up to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The challenge is to recognize the more severe and/or progressive pathology. A reliable non-invasive method does not exist. Untargeted metabolomics is a novel method to discover biomarkers and give insights on diseases pathophysiology. Objectives: We applied metabolomics to understand if simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients have peculiar metabolites profiles that can differentiate them among each-others and from controls. Methods: Metabolomics signatures were obtained from 307 subjects from two separated enrollments. The first collected samples from 69 controls and 144 patients (78 steatosis, 23 NASH, 15 NASH-cirrhosis, 8 HCV-cirrhosis, 20 cryptogenic cirrhosis). The second, used as validation-set, enrolled 44 controls and 50 patients (34 steatosis, 10 NASH and 6 NASH-cirrhosis).The “Partial-Least-Square Discriminant-Analysis”(PLS-DA) was used to reveal class separation in metabolomics profiles between patients and controls and among each class of patients, and to reveal the metabolites contributing to class differentiation. Results: Several metabolites were selected as relevant, in particular:Glycocholic acid, Taurocholic acid, Phenylalanine, branched-chain amino-acids increased at the increase of the severity of the disease from steatosis to NASH, NASH-cirrhosis, while glutathione decreased (p < 0.001 for each). Moreover, an ensemble machine learning (EML) model was built (comprehending 10 different mathematical models) to verify diagnostic performance, showing an accuracy > 80% in NAFLD clinical stages prediction. Conclusions: Metabolomics profiles of NAFLD patients could be a useful tool to non-invasively diagnose NAFLD and discriminate among the various stages of the disease, giving insights into its pathophysiology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and  morbidity worldwide. Four out of five CVD deaths are due to myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite many initiatives that have been established for CVD prevention and risk management, and new therapies to treat existing CVD, patients continue to die from cardiac events. Clearly, we need to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies. Metabolomics offers a novel solution to this problem, as metabolomics-based biomarkers do not only indicate the presence or absence of a disease, but are also capable of assessing risks of developing the disease and detecting the disease prior to the appearance of overt clinical symptoms. METHOD: In this review, we describe the analytical techniques and workflow used in untargeted metabolomics. We also identify several case studies that highlight the use of untargeted metabolomics in cardiovascular research. RESULTS: Five case studies that employ untargeted metabolomics approaches to identify biomarkers for cardiovascular risk, myocardial ischemia, transient ischemic attack, incident coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction risk prediction are described. The use of the untargeted metabolomics is still relatively new in cardiovascular research. As such, there remains a need for future advancement in metabolomic technologies. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of CVDs and identification of patients at high risk of developing adverse events would allow for timely intervention that prevents serious consequences or death. There is a need to establish sensitive and non-invasive CV biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of CVDs.},

The diagnose of CD relays on the comprehensive evaluation of patient symptoms, laboratory examination, radiology, and endoscopy. There is lack of biomarkers or simple test for CD detection. Serum samples from healthy subjects (n = 16) and CD patients (n = 16) were collected and prepared for untargeted metabolomics analysis using the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) method. The alterations of serum metabolites and the potential biomarkers were profiled by statistical analysis. And the associated metabolic pathway was analyzed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The performance of potential biomarkers was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A complete separation between HS and CD groups was seen in OPLS-DA. A total of 108 and 131 significantly altered metabolites in positive and negative ion mode, respectively, were identified, and most of them belong to several pathways ranging from lipid metabolism to amino acid metabolism and energy homeostasis. KEGG analysis revealed that lipid metabolism enriched most significantly. Further, ceramide, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) presented the highest predictive accuracy of the patients with CD as analyzed by ROC. The current study demonstrated that lipid metabolism is mostly related to CD pathogenesis. Further investigations are indicated to examine the use of lipid-related metabolites of ceramide, PE, and TCDCA as potential biomarkers for CD diagnosis.},

Here we present CAMERA, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7% and 90.3% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We demonstrate the utility of CAMERA in two different, easily adoptable plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of CAMERA drastically reduced the amount of manual analysis. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing. Results: We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments. Conclusions: IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We were also able to show the potential of IPO to increase the reliability of metabolomics data.},

   abstract = {Fungi occupy diverse environmental niches and many have evolved to live a pathogenic lifestyle , causing devastating diseases in plants and animals. The interface between host and pathogen is complex and constantly evolving. Pathogens secrete effector proteins that manipulate the host to the pathogen's advantage. Depending on their infection strategy, fungal pathogens may deliver apoplastic effectors into the extracellular spaces and/or cytoplasmic effectors that are taken up by plant cells. Effectors have a broad functional spectrum, ranging from effectors in necrotrophic pathogens with toxic activity that cause plant cell death to avirulence (Avr) ef-fectors in biotrophic pathogens that trigger defense responses and that the plant immune system has evolved to recognize. Molecular studies have revealed over 60 fungal effectors from different species; however, this represents only the tip of the iceberg. For example, only six ef-fectors have thus far been characterized across three rust fungi, while more than 30 Avr speci-ficities have been identified in flax rust and around 50 in each of stem rust, stripe rust, and leaf rust [1]. Similarly, over 40 Avr specificities occur in interactions between Magnaporthe oryzae and rice [2]. With the rising number of sequenced pathogen genomes, computational prediction of effec-tor proteins holds promise as a fast and economical technique to define candidates for subsequent laboratory work. Bacterial effectors delivered to the host via dedicated pathogen-derived delivery mechanisms, such as the type III secretion system, can be predicted using machine learning approaches based on protein sequence information. In oomycetes, consensus sequence motifs implicated in host translocation, such as RXLR, can be exploited for effector prediction. However, computational effector prediction in fungi is challenging due to a lack of known protein features that are common to fungal effectors and the low number of characterized effectors for individual species, which limits the use of machine learning approaches. Fungal effector prediction is a difficult problem due to the lack of unifying sequence features or structural folds for effectors within and across species. In general, fungal effectors do not share PLOS Pathogens |},

   abstract = {Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

   abstract = {The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis, known as maize (corn) smut, induces plant tumours through the action of effectors that are translocated into the plant tissue. One of these effectors is now shown to be a chorismate mutase, Cmu1. The enzyme is taken up by the host plant cells where it lowers salicylic acid levels, priming them for a successful infection. Inactivation of Cmu1 abolishes virulence, suggesting an interesting new target for disease intervention. Many plant pathogens encode secreted chorismate mutases, indicating a widely used mechanism. Maize smut caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis is a widespread disease characterized by the development of large plant tumours. U. maydis is a biotrophic pathogen that requires living plant tissue for its development and establishes an intimate interaction zone between fungal hyphae and the plant plasma membrane. U. maydis actively suppresses plant defence responses by secreted protein effectors1,2. Its effector repertoire comprises at least 386 genes mostly encoding proteins of unknown function1,3,4 and expressed exclusively during the biotrophic stage3. The U. maydis secretome also contains about 150 proteins with probable roles in fungal nutrition, fungal cell wall modification and host penetration as well as proteins unlikely to act in the fungal-host interface4 like a chorismate mutase. Chorismate mutases are key enzymes of the shikimate pathway and catalyse the conversion of chorismate to prephenate, the precursor for tyrosine and phenylalanine synthesis. Root-knot nematodes inject a secreted chorismate mutase into plant cells likely to affect development5,6. Here we show that the chorismate mutase Cmu1 secreted by U. maydis is a virulence factor. The enzyme is taken up by plant cells, can spread to neighbouring cells and changes the metabolic status of these cells through metabolic priming. Secreted chorismate mutases are found in many plant-associated microbes and might serve as general tools for host manipulation.},

   abstract = {Multicellular organisms activate immunity upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Chitin is the major component of fungal cell walls, and chitin oligosaccharides act as PAMPs in plant and mammalian cells. Microbial pathogens deliver effector proteins to suppress PAMP-triggered host immunity and to establish infection. Here, we show that the LysM domain-containing effector protein Ecp6 of the fungal plant pathogen Cladosporium fulvum mediates virulence through perturbation of chitin-triggered host immunity. During infection, Ecp6 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides that are released from the cell walls of invading hyphae to prevent elicitation of host immunity. This may represent a common strategy of host immune suppression by fungal pathogens, because LysM effectors are widely conserved in the fungal kingdom.},

   abstract = {Fungi and oomycetes deliver effectors into living plant cells to suppress defenses and control plant processes needed for infection. Little is known about the mechanism by which these pathogens translocate effector proteins across the plasma membrane into the plant cytoplasm. The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae secretes cytoplasmic effectors into a specialized biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) before translocation. Here, we show that cytoplasmic effectors within BICs are packaged into punctate membranous effector compartments that are occasionally observed in the host cytoplasm. Live cell imaging with fluorescently labeled proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) showed that these effector puncta colocalize with the plant plasma membrane and with CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, a component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Inhibiting CME using virus-induced gene silencing and chemical treatments resulted in cytoplasmic effectors in swollen BICs lacking effector puncta. By contrast, fluorescent marker colocalization, gene silencing, and chemical inhibitor studies failed to support a major role for clathrin-independent endocytosis in effector translocation. Effector localization patterns indicated that cytoplasmic effector translocation occurs underneath appressoria before invasive hyphal growth. Taken together, this study provides evidence that cytoplasmic effector translocation is mediated by CME in BICs and suggests a role for M. oryzae effectors in coopting plant endocytosis.},

However, the mechanism by which these fungal sRNAs are secreted and enter host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The B. cinerea tetraspanin protein, Punchless 1 (BcPLS1), serves as an EV biomarker and plays an essential role in fungal pathogenicity. We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of the CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that fungi secrete sRNAs via EVs, which then enter host plant cells mainly through CME. Fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea can send sRNAs to plant cells to suppress plant immunity. Here the authors demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME).},

How RXLR effectors from the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans enter host cells is unknown. One possible route involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Transient silencing of NbCHC, encoding clathrin heavy chain, or the endosome marker gene NbAra6 encoding a Rab GTPase in the model host Nicotiana benthamiana, attenuated P. infestans infection and reduced translocation of RXLR effector fusions from transgenic pathogen strains into host cells. By contrast, silencing PP1c isoforms, susceptibility factors not required for endocytosis, reduced infection but did not attenuate RXLR effector uptake. Endosome enrichment by ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient fractionation revealed co-localization of RXLR effector Pi04314-RFP with clathrin-coated vesicles. Immunopurification of clathrin- and NbAra6-associated vesicles during infection showed that RXLR effectors Pi04314-RFP and AvrBlb1-RFP, but not apoplastic effector PiSCR74-RFP, were co-immunoprecipitated during infection with pathogen strains secreting these effectors. Tandem mass spectrometry analyses of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with NbAra6-GFP during infection revealed enrichment of host proteins associated with endocytic vesicles alongside multiple pathogen RXLR effectors, but not apoplastic effectors, including PiSCR74, which do not enter host cells. Our data show that the uptake of P. infestans RXLR effectors into plant cells occurs via CME.},

Computational effector candidate identification and subsequent functional characterization delivers valuable insights into plant-pathogen interactions. However, effector prediction in fungi has been challenging due to a lack of unifying sequence features such as conserved N-terminal sequence motifs. Fungal effectors are commonly predicted from secretomes based on criteria such as small size and cysteine-rich, which suffers from poor accuracy. We present EffectorP which pioneers the application of machine learning to fungal effector prediction. EffectorP improves fungal effector prediction from secretomes based on a robust signal of sequence-derived properties, achieving sensitivity and specificity of over 80%. Features that discriminate fungal effectors from secreted noneffectors are predominantly sequence length, molecular weight and protein net charge, as well as cysteine, serine and tryptophan content. We demonstrate that EffectorP is powerful when combined with in planta expression data for predicting high-priority effector candidates. EffectorP is the first prediction program for fungal effectors based on machine learning. Our findings will facilitate functional fungal effector studies and improve our understanding of effectors in plant-pathogen interactions. EffectorP is available at http://effectorp.csiro.au.},

Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors generally do not share sequence homology. However, they occupy similar host environments, either the plant apoplast or plant cytoplasm, and, therefore, may share some unifying properties based on the requirements of these host compartments. Here, we exploit these biological signals and present the first classifier (EffectorP 3.0) that uses two machine-learning models: one trained on apoplastic effectors and one trained on cytoplasmic effectors. EffectorP 3.0 accurately predicts known apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungal and oomycete secretomes with low estimated false-positive rates of 3 and 8%, respectively. Cytoplasmic effectors have a higher proportion of positively charged amino acids, whereas apoplastic effectors are enriched for cysteine residues. The combination of fungal and oomycete effectors in training leads to a higher number of predicted cytoplasmic effectors in biotrophic fungi. EffectorP 3.0 expands predicted effector repertoires beyond small, cysteine-rich secreted proteins in fungi and RxLR-motif containing secreted proteins in oomycetes. We show that signal peptide prediction is essential for accurate effector prediction, because EffectorP 3.0 recognizes a cytoplasmic signal also in intracellular, nonsecreted proteins.},

   abstract = {Elucidating the similarity and diversity of pathogen effectors is critical to understand their evolution across fungal phytopathogens. However, rapid divergence that diminishes sequence similarities between putatively homologous effectors has largely concealed the roots of effector evolution. Here we modelled the structures of 26,653 secreted proteins from 14 agriculturally important fungal phytopathogens, six non-pathogenic fungi and one oomycete with AlphaFold 2. With 18,000 successfully predicted folds, we performed structure-guided comparative analyses on two aspects of effector evolution: uniquely expanded sequence-unrelated structurally similar (SUSS) effector families and common folds present across the fungal species. Extreme expansion of lineage-specific SUSS effector families was found only in several obligate biotrophs, Blumeria graminis and Puccinia graminis. The highly expanded effector families were the source of conserved sequence motifs, such as the Y/F/WxC motif. We identified new classes of SUSS effector families that include known virulence factors, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50 and Tin2. Structural comparisons revealed that the expanded structural folds further diversify through domain duplications and fusion with disordered stretches. Putatively sub- and neo-functionalized SUSS effectors could reconverge on regulation, expanding the functional pools of effectors in the pathogen infection cycle. We also found evidence that many effector families could have originated from ancestral folds conserved across fungi. Collectively, our study highlights diverse effector evolution mechanisms and supports divergent evolution as a major force in driving SUSS effector evolution from ancestral proteins. Evolutionary analysis guided by predicted structures of AlphaFold 2 elucidates novel aspects of rapidly evolving pathogen effectors from fungal phytopathogens.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. AlphaFold predicts protein structures with an accuracy competitive with experimental structures in the majority of cases using a novel deep learning architecture.},

However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

Pathogens secrete effector molecules to interfere with the immune recognition or signaling network and reprogram cell structure or metabolism. Understanding the effector repertoires of diverse pathogens will contribute to unraveling the molecular mechanism of virulence and developing sustainable disease-control strategies for crops and natural ecosystems. Effector functionality has been investigated extensively in only a small number of pathogen species. However, many more pathogen genomes are becoming available, and much can be learned from a broader view of effector biology in diverse pathosystems. The purpose of this review is to summarize methodology for computational prediction of protein effectors, functional characterization of effector proteins and their targets , and the use of effectors as probes to screen for new sources of host resistance. Although these techniques were generally developed in model pathosystems, many of the approaches are directly applicable for exploration and exploitation of effector biology in pathosystems that are less well studied. We hope to facilitate such exploration, which will broaden understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the biological diversity of plant-pathogen interactions, and maximize the impact of new approaches that leverage effector biology for disease control.},

More recently, we have shown that spray applications of CYP3RNA also protect barley from fungal infection via a process termed spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS). Thus, RNAi technology may have the potential to revolutionize plant protection in agriculture. Therefore, successful field application will require optimization of RNAi design necessary to maximize the efficacy of the RNA silencing construct for making RNAi-based strategies a realistic and sustainable approach in agriculture. Previous studies indicate that silencing is correlated with the number of siRNAs generated from a dsRNA precursor. To prove the hypothesis that silencing efficiency is correlated with the number of siRNAs processed out of the dsRNA precursor, we tested in a HIGS and SIGS approach dsRNA precursors of increasing length ranging from 400 nt to 1500 nt to assess gene silencing efficiency of individual FgCYP51 genes. Concerning HIGS-mediated disease control, we found that there is no significant correlation between the length of the dsRNA precursor and the reduction of Fg infection on CYP51-dsRNA-expressing Arabidopsis plants. Importantly and in clear contrast to HIGS, we measured a decrease in SIGS-mediated Fg disease resistance that significantly correlates with the length of the dsRNA construct that was sprayed, indicating that the size of the dsRNA interferes with a sufficient uptake of dsRNAs by the fungus.},

   abstract = {Background: Members of the F. oxysporium species complex (FOSC) in the f. sp. apii (Foa) are pathogenic on celery and those in f. sp. coriandrii (Foci) are pathogenic on coriander (=cilantro). Foci was first reported in California in 2005; a new and highly aggressive race 4 of Foa was observed in 2013 in California. Preliminary evidence indicated that Foa can also cause disease on coriander, albeit are less virulent than Foci. Comparative genomics was used to investigate the evolutionary relationships between Foa race 4, Foa race 3, and the Foci, which are all in FOSC Clade 2, and Foa race 2, which is in FOSC Clade 3. Results: A phylogenetic analysis of 2718 single-copy conserved genes and mitochondrial DNA sequence indicated that Foa races 3 and 4 and the Foci are monophyletic within FOSC Clade 2; these strains also are in a single somatic compatibility group. However, in the accessory genomes, the Foci versus Foa races 3 and 4 differ in multiple contigs. Based on significantly increased expression of Foa race 4 genes in planta vs. in vitro, we identified 23 putative effectors and 13 possible pathogenicity factors. PCR primers for diagnosis of either Foa race 2 or 4 and the Foci were identified. Finally, mixtures of conidia that were pre-stained with different fluorochromes indicated that Foa race 4 formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs) with Foci. Foa race 4 and Foa race 2, which are in different somatic compatibility groups, did not form CATs with each other. Conclusions: There was no evidence that Foa race 2 was involved in the recent evolution of Foa race 4; Foa race 2 and 4 are CAT-incompatible. Although Foa races 3 and 4 and the Foci are closely related, there is no evidence that either Foci contributed to the evolution of Foa race 4, or that Foa race 4 was the recent recipient of a multi-gene chromosomal segment from another strain. However, horizontal chromosome transfer could account for the major difference in the accessory genomes of Foa race 4 and the Foci and for their differences in host range.},

   abstract = {Advances in modern sequencing technologies allow us to generate sufficient data to analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes from a single machine in a single day. This potential for sequencing massive numbers of genomes calls for fully automated methods to produce high-quality assemblies and variant calls. We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3-5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ~15%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.},

   abstract = {Long nanopore reads are advantageous in de novo genome assembly. However, nanopore reads usually have broad error distribution and high-error-rate subsequences. Existing error correction tools cannot correct nanopore reads efficiently and effectively. Most methods trim high-error-rate subsequences during error correction, which reduces both the length of the reads and contiguity of the final assembly. Here, we develop an error correction, and de novo assembly tool designed to overcome complex errors in nanopore reads. We propose an adaptive read selection and two-step progressive method to quickly correct nanopore reads to high accuracy. We introduce a two-stage assembler to utilize the full length of nanopore reads. Our tool achieves superior performance in both error correction and de novo assembling nanopore reads. It requires only 8122 hours to assemble a 35X coverage human genome and achieves a 2.47-fold improvement in NG50. Furthermore, our assembly of the human WERI cell line shows an NG50 of 22 Mbp. The high-quality assembly of nanopore reads can significantly reduce false positives in structure variation detection. Nanopore reads have been advantageous for de novo genome assembly; however these reads have high error rates. Here, the authors develop an error correction and de novo assembly tool, NECAT, which produces efficient, high quality assemblies of nanopore reads.},

   abstract = { Pathogenic isolates of Fusarium oxysporum , distinguished as formae speciales (f. spp.) on the basis of their host specificity, cause crown rots, root rots and vascular wilts on many important crops worldwide. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae (FOC) is particularly problematic to onion growers worldwide and is increasing in prevalence in the UK. We characterized 31 F. oxysporum isolates collected from UK onions using pathogenicity tests, sequencing of housekeeping genes and identification of effectors. In onion seedling and bulb tests, 21 isolates were pathogenic and 10 were non‐pathogenic. The molecular characterization of these isolates, and 21 additional isolates comprising other f. spp. and different Fusarium species, was carried out by sequencing three housekeeping genes. A concatenated tree separated the F. oxysporum isolates into six clades, but did not distinguish between pathogenic and non‐pathogenic isolates. Ten putative effectors were identified within FOC, including seven Secreted In Xylem ( SIX ) genes first reported in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici . Two highly homologous proteins with signal peptides and RxLR motifs ( CRX1 / CRX2 ) and a gene with no previously characterized domains ( C5 ) were also identified. The presence/absence of nine of these genes was strongly related to pathogenicity against onion and all were shown to be expressed in planta . Different SIX gene complements were identified in other f. spp., but none were identified in three other Fusarium species from onion. Although the FOC SIX genes had a high level of homology with other f. spp., there were clear differences in sequences which were unique to FOC, whereas CRX1 and C5 genes appear to be largely FOC specific. },

   abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. © The Author(s) 2012.

The fungus has a complex evolutionary history and taxonomic repute and consists of three pathogenic races and at least 24 vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). Surveys conducted in Asia, Africa, the Sultanate of Oman and Mauritius encountered isolates of F. oxysporum pathogenic to banana that were not compatible to any of the known Foc VCGs. Genetic relatedness between the undescribed and known Foc VCGs were determined using a multi-gene phylogeny and diversity array technology (DArT) sequencing. The presence of putative effector genes, the secreted in xylem (SIX) genes, were also determined. Fourteen novel Foc VCGs and 17 single-member VCGs were identified. The multi-gene tree was congruent with the DArT-seq phylogeny and divided the novel VCGs into three clades. Clustering analysis of the DArT-seq data supported the separation of Foc isolates into eight distinct clusters, with the suite of SIX genes mostly conserved within these clusters. Results from this study indicates that Foc is more diverse than hitherto assumed.},

   abstract = { Currently, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. apii ( Foa ) race 4 in celery and F. oxysporum f. sp. coriandrii ( Foci ) in coriander have the characteristics of emerging infectious plant diseases in coastal southern California: the pathogens are spreading, yield losses can be severe, and there are currently no economical solutions for their control. Celery, and possibly coriander, production in these regions is are likely to have more severe disease from projected warmer conditions in the historically cool, coastal regions. Experimental evidence shows that Foa race 4 causes much higher disease severity when temperatures exceed 21°C. A phylogenomic analysis indicated that Foa race 4, an older, less virulent, and uncommon Foa race 3, and two Foci are closely related in their conserved genomes. These closely related genotypes are somatically compatible. Foa race 4 can also cause disease in coriander and the two organisms readily form “hetero” conidial anastomosis tubes (CAT), further increasing the likelihood of parasexual recombination and the generation of novel pathotypes. A horizontal chromosome transfer event likely accounts for the difference in host range between Foci versus Foa races 4 and 3 because they differ primarily in one or two accessory chromosomes. How Foa race 4 evolved its hyper-virulence is unknown. Although the accessory chromosomes of Foa races 3 and 4 are highly similar, there is no evidence that Foa race 4 evolved directly from race 3, and races 3 and 4 probably only have a common ancestor. Foa race 2, which is in a different clade within the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) than the other Foa , did not contribute to the evolution of race 4, and does not form CATs with Foa race 4; consequently, while inter-isolate CAT formation is genetically less restrictive than somatic compatibility, it might be more restricted between FOSC clades than currently known. Other relatively new F. oxysporum in coastal California include F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae on strawberry ( Fof ). Curiously, Fof “yellows-fragariae” isolates also have similar core genomes to Foa races 4 and 3 and Foci , perhaps suggesting that there may be core genome factors in this lineage that favor establishment in these soils. },

The two high-quality assemblies reported here will be a valuable resource for the comparative analysis of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense races at the pathogenic level.},

   abstract = {Fusarium wilt of banana, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is one of the most damaging plant diseases recorded. Foc race 1 (R1) decimated the Gros Michel-based banana trade. Currently, tropical race 4 (TR4) is threatening the global production of its replacement cultivar, Cavendish banana. Population genomics and phylogenetics revealed that all Cavendish banana-infecting race 4 strains shared an evolutionary origin that is distinct from R1 strains. The TR4 genome lacks accessory or pathogenicity chromosomes, reported in other F. oxysporum genomes. Accessory genes-enriched for virulence and mitochondrial-related functions-are attached to ends of some core chromosomes. Meta-transcriptomics revealed the unique induction of the entire mitochondria-localized nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis pathway upon TR4 infection. Empirically, we confirmed the unique induction of NO burst in TR4,suggesting the involvement of nitrosative pressure in its virulence. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrated the functional importance of accessory genes SIX1 and SIX4 as virulent factors.},

   abstract = {Plants possess large arsenals of immune receptors capable of recognizing all pathogen classes. To cause disease, pathogenic organisms must be able to overcome physical barriers, suppress or evade immune perception, and derive nutrients from host tissues. Consequently, to facilitate some of these processes, pathogens secrete effector proteins that promote colonization. This review covers recent advances in the field of effector biology, focusing on conserved cellular processes targeted by effectors from diverse pathogens. The ability of effectors to facilitate pathogen entry into the host interior, suppress plant immune perception, and alter host physiology for pathogen benefit is discussed. Pathogens also deploy effectors in a spatial and temporal manner, depending on infection stage. Recent advances have also enhanced our understanding of effectors acting in specific plant organs and tissues. Effectors are excellent cellular probes that facilitate insight into biological processes as well as key points of vulnerability in plant immune signaling networks.},

   abstract = {Banana Fusarium wilt (BFW) is a devastating disease with no effective cure methods. Timely and effective detection of the disease and evaluation of its spreading trend will help farmers in making right decisions on plantation management. The main purpose of this study was to find the spectral features of the BFW-infected canopy and build the optimal BFW classification models for different stages of infection. A RedEdge-MX camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect multispectral images of a banana plantation infected with BFW in July and August 2020. Three types of spectral features were used as the inputs of classification models, including three-visible-band images, five-multispectral-band images, and vegetation indices (VIs). Four supervised methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Logistic Regression (LR), and two unsupervised methods including Hotspot Analysis (HA) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) were adopted to detect the BFW-infected canopies. Comparing to the healthy canopies, the BFW-infected canopies had higher reflectance in the visible region, but lower reflectance in the NIR region. The classification results showed that most of the supervised and unsupervised methods reached excellent accuracies. Among all the supervised methods, RF based on the five-multispectral-band was considered as the optimal model, with higher overall accuracy (OA) of 97.28% and faster running time of 22 min. For the unsupervised methods, HA reached high and balanced OAs of more than 95% based on the selected VIs derived from the red and NIR band, especially for WDRVI, NDVI, and TDVI. By comprehensively evaluating the classification results of different metrics, the unsupervised method HA was recommended for BFW recognition, especially in the late stage of infection; the supervised method RF was recommended in the early stage of infection to reach a slightly higher accuracy. The results found in this study could give advice for banana plantation management and provide approaches for plant disease detection.},

Monoculturing of the commercial cultivars over a long period led their vulnerability to pest and diseases. This situation is threatening the food and livelihood security. Being a vegetatively propagated crop, and its inherent problem of seed setting owing to polyploidy, parthenocarpy, and sterility, tailoring a variety with desirable traits through conventional breeding is a challenge to the breeders. This can be achieved through molecular breeding approaches demanding basic and complete understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in trait expression in mind, cost-effective next-generation sequencing technologies have been exploited for unraveling the molecular mechanisms of various traits, ripening, biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance/resistance, etc., at genomic and transcriptomic levels. The remaining “omics” approaches aimed to study the complex interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites within the resulting phenotype to open new avenues for breeding better bananas. Research on “omics” of pest and diseases also paved a way to reveal the host pathogen interactions, to develop strategies for management. This chapter tries to cover all the “omics platforms” for various traits and their applications in banana improvement program.},

This renders cell omics seemingly, like the universe, expand with no limit and our goal toward the complete harness of the cellular system merely impossible. Therefore, it is imperative to review what has been done and is being done to predict what can be done toward the translation of omics information to disease control with minimal cell perturbation. With a focus on the “four big omics,” i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, we delineate hierarchies of these omics together with their epiomics and interactomics, and review technologies developed for interrogation.

Application of biochar improved soil properties, pepper plant nutrition and increased activities of enzymes related to pest/disease resistance, leading to superior physiological performance and lesser F. wilt disease incidence than plants from CCS. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were involved in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (fruit), plant pathogen interaction (fruit), photosynthesis (leaf), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (both tissues) and metabolic pathways (both tissues).

Factors causing this incomplete systemic spread of Xvm are not fully known yet could be important for XW management. We explored the effect of 1) Xvm inoculum amounts; 2) number, size, and position of suckers on mother plant corms; and 3) other mother plant attributes on sucker colonization. A shorter (p < 0.05) incubation period (17.9 vs 21.1 days) and higher (p < .001) cumulative number of symptomatic leaves (5.2 vs 1.6 leaves) was observed when all leaves compared to only two leaves were inoculated. Xvm was recovered in corms at 29 days post inoculation (dpi) in both treatments with no differences (p > 0.05) in proportions of corms with Xvm between the treatments. However, Xvm was recovered earlier and at a higher frequency in attached suckers when all leaves were inoculated. Lower Xvm recoveries occurred in the lower corm sections to which most suckers were attached relative to the middle and upper corm sections. Xvm incidence in corms increased with the number of attached maiden suckers, and the dpi, while it declined with increasing mother plant pseudostem and corm height. Thus, Xvm spread within mats is influenced by the amount of inoculum and the physiological stage of the mother plant and attached suckers. The position of suckers, predominantly at the bottom of corms also protects them from infection. Measures that reduce Xvm inoculum build-up in mats will thus minimize within mat Xvm spread. },

   abstract = { The drought stress responses of vascular plants are complex regulatory mechanisms because they include various physiological responses from signal perception under water deficit conditions to the acquisition of drought stress resistance at the whole-plant level. It is thought that plants first recognize water deficit conditions in roots and that several molecular signals then move from roots to shoots. Finally, a phytohormone, abscisic acid (ABA) is synthesized mainly in leaves. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of stress sensors and the regulators that initiate ABA biosynthesis in response to drought stress conditions are still unclear. Another important issue is how plants adjust ABA propagation, stress-mediated gene expression and metabolite composition to acquire drought stress resistance in different tissues throughout the whole plant. In this review, we summarize recent advances in research on drought stress responses, focusing on long-distance signaling from roots to shoots, ABA synthesis and transport, and metabolic regulation in both cellular and whole-plant levels of Arabidopsis and crops. We also discuss coordinated mechanisms for acquiring drought stress adaptations and resistance via tissue-to-tissue communication and long-distance signaling. },

   abstract = { Global crop production is greatly reduced by vascular diseases. These diseases include bacterial blight of rice and crucifer black rot caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ) and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris ( Xcc ). The molecular mechanisms that activate vascular defense against such pathogens remains underexplored. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP1) mutant has increased host susceptibility to the adapted pathogen Xcc and is compromised in nonhost resistance to the rice pathogen Xoo . MKP1 regulates MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor MYB4 that negatively regulates vascular lignification through inhibiting lignin biosynthesis. Induction of lignin biosynthesis is, therefore, an important part of vascular-specific immunity. The role of MKP-MAPK-MYB signaling in lignin biosynthesis and vascular resistance to Xoo is conserved in rice, indicating that these factors form a tissue-specific defense regulatory network. Our study likely reveals a major vascular immune mechanism that underlies tissue-specific disease resistance against bacterial pathogens in plants. },

   abstract = { Although healthy plants are vital to human and animal health, plant health is often overlooked in the One Health literature. Plants provide over 80% of the food consumed by humans and are the primary source of nutrition for livestock. However, plant diseases and pests often threaten the availability and safety of plants for human and animal consumption. Global yield losses of important staple crops can range up to 30% and hundreds of billions of dollars in lost food production. To demonstrate the complex interrelationships between plants and public health, we present four case studies on plant health issues directly tied to food safety and/or security, and how a One Health approach influences the perception and mitigation of these issues. Plant pathogens affect food availability and consequently food security through reductions in yield and plant mortality as shown through the first case study of banana Xanthomonas wilt in East and Central Africa. Case studies 2, 3 and 4 highlight ways in which the safety of plant-based foods can also be compromised. Case study 2 describes the role of mycotoxin-producing plant-colonizing fungi in human and animal disease and examines lessons learned from outbreaks of aflatoxicosis in Kenya. Plants may also serve as vectors of human pathogens as seen in case study 3, with an example of Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination of lettuce in North America. Finally, case study 4 focuses on the use of pesticides in Suriname, a complex issue intimately tied to food security though protection of crops from diseases and pests, while also a food safety issue through misuse. These cases from around the world in low to high income countries point to the need for interdisciplinary teams to solve complex plant health problems. Through these case studies, we examine challenges and opportunities moving forward for mitigating negative public health consequences and ensuring health equity. Advances in surveillance technology and functional and streamlined workflow, from data collection, analyses, risk assessment, reporting, and information sharing are needed to improve the response to emergence and spread of plant-related pathogens and pests. Our case studies point to the importance of collaboration in responses to plant health issues that may become public health emergencies and the value of the One Health approach in ensuring food safety and food security for the global population. },

   abstract = {The challenge of feeding the current and future world population is widely recognized, and the management of plant diseases has an important role in overcoming this. This paper explores the ways in which international plant pathology has contributed and continues to support efforts to secure adequate, safe and culturally appropriate nourishment and livelihoods for present and future generations. For the purposes of this paper, “international plant pathology” refers to the work that plant pathologists do when they work across international borders, with a focus on enhancing food security in tropical regions. Significant efforts involve public and philanthropic resources from the global North for addressing plant disease concerns in the global South, where food security is a legitimate and pressing concern. International disease management efforts are also aimed at protecting domestic food security, for example when pathogens of major staples migrate across national borders. In addition, some important crops are largely produced in tropical countries and consumed globally, including in industrialized countries; the diseases of these crops are of international interest, and they are largely managed by the private sector. Finally, host−microbe interactions are fascinating biological systems, and basic research on plant diseases of international relevance has often yielded insights and technologies with both scientific and practical implications.},

   abstract = {The discipline of plant pathology has an expanding remit requiring a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach to capture the complexity of interactions for any given disease, disease complex or syndrome. This review discussed recent developments in plant pathology research and identifies some key issues that, we anticipate, must be faced to meet the food security and environmental challenges that will arise over coming decades. In meeting these issues, the challenge in turn is for the plant pathology community to respond by contributing to a wider forum for multidisciplinary research, recognising that impact will depend not just on advances in the plant pathology discipline alone, but on interactions more broadly with other agricultural and ecological sciences, and with the needs of national and global policies and regulation. A challenge more readily met once plant pathologists again gather physically at international meetings and return to the professional and social encounters that are fertile grounds for developing new ideas and forging collaborative approaches both within plant pathology and with other disciplines. In this review we emphasise, in particular: the multidisciplinary links between plant pathology and other disciplines; disease management, including precision agriculture, plant growth and development, and decision analysis and disease risk; the development and use of new and novel plant protection chemicals; new ways of exploiting host genetic diversity including host resistance deployment; a new perspective on biological control and microbial interactions; advances in surveillance and detection technologies; invasion of exotic and re-emerging plant pathogens; and the consequences of climate change affecting all aspects of agriculture, the environment, and their interactions. We draw conclusions in each of these areas, but in reaching forward over the next few decades, these inevitably lead to further research questions rather than solutions to the challenges we anticipate.},

The development of a molecular diagnostic capable of reliably distinguishing between the various races of the pathogen is of key importance to disease management. However, attempts to distinguish isolates using the standard molecular loci typically used for fungal phylogenetics have been complicated by a poor correlation between phylogeny and pathogenicity. Among the available alternative loci are several putative effector genes, known as  SIX  genes, which have been successfully used to differentiate the three races of  F . oxysporum  f. sp. lycopersici . In this study, an international collection of F oc isolates was screened for the presence of the putative effector  SIX 8  . Using a PCR and sequencing approach, variation in  F oc‐ SIX 8  was identified which allowed race 4 to be differentiated from race 1 and 2 isolates, and tropical and subtropical race 4 isolates to be distinguished from one another. },

   abstract = { Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae (Fol) causes a vascular disease in lettuce that results in significant yield losses. Race-specific and sensitive real-time PCR assays were developed for Fol races 1 and 4, which are prevalent in Europe. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, unique DNA loci specific to each race were identified and subsequently used for the design of primers and hydrolysis probes. Two assays per race were developed to ensure specificity. The two assays of each race could be run in duplex format, while still giving a sensitivity of 100 fg genomic DNA for all assays. Sample preparation methods were developed for plant tissue, soil, and surfaces, with an extra enrichment step when additional sensitivity was required. By controlling the incubation conditions during the enrichment step, the real-time PCR signal could be matched to the number of spore equivalents in the original sample. When enriching naturally infested soil, down to six conidiospore equivalents L -1 soil could be detected. As enrichment ensures sensitive detection and focuses on living Fol propagules, it facilitates the evaluation of control measures. The developed detection methods for soil and surfaces were applied to samples from commercial lettuce farms and confirmed the prevalence of Fol race 4 in Belgium. Monitoring of soil disinfestation events revealed that despite a dramatic decrease in quantity, the pathogen could still be detected either immediately after sheet steaming or after harvesting the first new crop. The detection method for plant tissue was successfully used to quantify Fol in lettuce inoculated with race 1, race 4 or a combination of both. Under the temperature conditions used, race 4 was more aggressive than race 1, as reflected in larger amounts of DNA of race 4 detected in the roots. These newly developed assays are a promising tool for epidemiological research as well as for the evaluation of control measures. },

Consequently, numerous efforts to understand and mitigate drought effects that include developing tolerant crop varieties are ongoing in several banana breeding programmes. The breeding efforts, however, have been greatly slowed down by inherent banana problems (polyploidy and male or female sterility) and complexity of drought tolerance (reportedly controlled by several genes). This review summarizes the pertinent research findings on water requirements of banana for its proper growth and productivity, symptoms of drought‐sensitive varieties and field management strategies to cope with drought stress. The coping strategies deployed by resistant cultivars include high assimilation rates and water retention capacity as well as minor losses in leaf area and gaseous exchange. Reduced bunch weight, leaf chlorosis, wilting and strangled birth are underlined to be directly associated with drought susceptibility. Integration of conventional, molecular breeding and biotechnological tools as well as exploitation of the existing banana genetic diversity presents a huge opportunity for successful banana improvement.},

With its specific characteristics, enset could reduce households’ vulnerability but this is poorly understood as orphan crops typically receive little research attention. We analyze the contribution of enset to household income, food security, and vulnerability to shocks. We use data from a comprehensive household survey, covering 684 rural households in Southern Ethiopia. We rely on the sustainable livelihoods framework to guide the empirical analysis and use a stepwise regression approach combined with a control function method to limit endogeneity bias. We find that household income slightly improves with enset cultivation, but food security does not. Yet, enset plants significantly reduce the negative impact of shocks on food security. Households with enset plants are less vulnerable to shocks and perceive less risk.},

   abstract = { Panama disease of banana, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense , is a serious constraint both to the commercial production of banana and cultivation for subsistence agriculture. Previous work has indicated that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense consists of several clonal lineages that may be genetically distant. In this study we tested whether lineages of the Panama disease pathogen have a monophyletic origin by comparing DNA sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. DNA sequences were obtained for translation elongation factor 1α and the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA genes for F. oxysporum strains from banana, pathogenic strains from other hosts and putatively nonpathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum . Cladograms for the two genes were highly concordant and a partition-homogeneity test indicated the two datasets could be combined. The tree inferred from the combined dataset resolved five lineages corresponding to “ F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense ” with a large dichotomy between two taxa represented by strains most commonly isolated from bananas with Panama disease. The results also demonstrate that the latter two taxa have significantly different chromosome numbers. F. oxysporum isolates collected as nonpathogenic or pathogenic to other hosts that have very similar or identical elongation factor 1α and mitochondrial small subunit genotypes as banana pathogens were shown to cause little or no disease on banana. Taken together, these results indicate Panama disease of banana is caused by fungi with independent evolutionary origins. },

   abstract = { Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense , the causal agent of fusarium wilt of banana ( Musa spp.), is one of the most destructive strains of the vascular wilt fungus F. oxysporum . Genetic relatedness among and within vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense was studied by sequencing two nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA regions in a collection of 70 F. oxysporum isolates that include representatives of 20 VCGs of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense , other formae speciales, and nonpathogens. To determine the ability of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense to sexually recombine, crosses were made between isolates of opposite mating types. Phylogenetic analysis separated the F. oxysporum isolates into two clades and eight lineages. Phylogenetic relationships between F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense and other formae speciales of F. oxysporum and the relationships among VCGs and races of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense clearly showed that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense 's ability to cause disease on banana has emerged multiple times, independently, and that the ability to cause disease to a specific banana cultivar is also a polyphyletic trait. These analyses further suggest that both coevolution with the host and horizontal gene transfer may have played important roles in the evolutionary history of the pathogen. All examined isolates harbored one of the two mating-type idiomorphs, but never both, which suggests a heterothallic mating system should sexual reproduction occur. Although, no sexual structures were observed, some lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense harbored MAT - 1 and MAT - 2 isolates, suggesting a potential that these lineages have a sexual origin that might be more recent than initially anticipated. },

AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine.

Although new protein structures are experimentally obtained over time, there is still a large difference between the number of protein sequences placed in Uniprot and those with resolved tertiary structure. In this context, studies have emerged to predict protein structures by methods based on a template or free modeling. In the last years, different methods have been combined to overcome their individual limitations, until the emergence of AlphaFold2, which demonstrated that predicting protein structure with high accuracy at unprecedented scale is possible. Despite its current impact in the field, AlphaFold2 has limitations. Recently, new methods based on protein language models have promised to revolutionize the protein structural biology allowing the discovery of protein structure and function only from evolutionary patterns present on protein sequence. Even though these methods do not reach AlphaFold2 accuracy, they already covered some of its limitations, being able to predict with high accuracy more than 200 million proteins from metagenomic databases. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the breakthroughs in protein structure prediction before and after AlphaFold2 emergence.},

@article{Kumar2020,
   abstract = {Improvement of edible bananas (a triploid and sterile crop) through conventional breeding is a challenging task owing to its recalcitrant nature for seed set, prolonged crop duration. In addition, the need of huge man power at different stages of progeny development and evaluation often leads to mislabeling, poor data management and loss of vital data. All this can be overcome by the application of advanced information technology source. This ensured secure and efficient data management such as storage, retrieval and data analysis and further could assist in tracking the breeding status in real time. Thus, a user-friendly web-based banana breeding tracker (BBT) has been developed using MySQL database with Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). This BBT works on all operating systems with access to multiple users from anywhere at any time. Quick responsive (QR) code labels can be generated by the tracker, which can be decoded using QR scanner. Also for each and every updated progress in breeding stages, a new QR code can be generated, which in turn reduce labeling errors. Moreover, the tracker has additional tools to search, sort and filter the data from the data sets for efficient retrieval and analysis. This tracker is being upgraded with phenotypic and genotypic data that will be made available in the public domain for hastening the banana improvement program.},
