Class shows the treatment time and group. Value shows the normalised peak intensity. Values show normalised peak intensity. Features were normalised to the sodium formate \ch{Na(NaCOOH)3} adduct ($m/z=226.9521$), log-transformed and scaled (Pareto scaling). Figure generated using MetaboAnalyst (v6.0).}
