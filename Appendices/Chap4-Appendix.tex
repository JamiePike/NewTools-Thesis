Samples C12.1, D15.1, D15.3, D15.4, F12.3, F15.1, F15.3, and F9.4 were identified as outliers and removed from the dataset. The blank samples were also removed from the statistical analysis.}

Class shows the treatment time and group. Value shows the normalised peak intensity. Values show normalised peak intensity. Features were normalised to the sodium formate Na(NaCOOH)3 adduct ($m/z=226.9521$), log-transformed and scaled (Pareto scaling). Figure generated using MetaboAnalyst (v6.0).}
